# Glossary

#### absolute
used in contrast with +relativity, to refer to a value that is defined without reference to some other comparison -- e.g., absolute zero temperature is the lowest value for temperature, irrespective of any conventional scale on which temperature is measured

#### adaptation
a property of a +neuron, where it tends to respond less vigorously over time to the same input stimulus.  this is an important aspect of +contrast as it causes neurons to respond to new things while ignoring older things.  also refers to a similar process in sensory +receptors where they adjust their responses to stimuli over time.

#### agnosia
lack of knowledge, often combined with a particular domain in which a person experiences this lack of knowledge, such as +prosopagnosia which is the lack of knowledge about faces (+prosocial agnosia)

#### anasagnosia
the lack of knowledge about one's own lack of knowledge -- see +agnosia

#### antisocial
attitude or behavior acting against other people -- the opposite of +prosocial

#### compression
one of the three C principles, reflecting the strong tendency of the brain to simplify or compress information, to the point that we can actually make sense of it.  this process starts in the individual +neuron.

#### excitatory
something that causes positive effects, especially in a +neuron, some inputs are excitatory and cause the neuron to be more likely to fire a +spike -- the opposite of +inhibitory

#### hallucinogenic
causing hallucinations, which are altered forms of perception, seeing things that are not really there.  Certain types of drugs including LSD are 

#### inhibitory
in neuroscience, causing a neuron to be less excited, or less likely to fire a +spike; more generally, anything that has an overall negative effect (on behavior, attitudes, etc) -- the opposite of +excitatory

#### interneuron
a class of +neuron in the brain that are only locally connected to neighboring groups of neurons, as contrasted with +pyramidal neurons that are +excitatory

#### millisecond
one thousandth (1/1000) of a second -- the fastest your brain can process information is roughly 200 milliseconds or 1/5 of a second

#### neuron
basic cell type in the brain that performs information processing via +compression of the roughly 10,000 input signals it receives, into a single spiking output that is broadcast to many other neurons

#### neocortex
the evolutionarily newest part of the brain, forming the outer-most layer, which is essential for all forms of cognition

#### normalized
to re-scale (via either subtraction or division) a value into a "normal" or standard range, often the 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 range.  for example, if you subtract the mean from a set of values, they are 0-normalized.  if you then divide those values by the standard deviation, then they are called "normal" values or `z` scores.  see also +standardized

#### perception
the higher-level product of cortical-level +compression and +contrast processing of lower-level +sensation signals

#### photons
the particle-like manifestation of electromagnetic radiation (light), which activate the +rod and +cone +receptors in the eye to create visual +sensation

#### prediction
the process of generating an expectation or guess as to what will happen next.  see +predictive-learning

#### predictive learning
an important way in which the brain learns, based on the difference between a +prediction and what actually happens

#### prosocial
an attitude favoring social engagement and generally helping others -- the opposite of +antisocial

#### prosopagnosia
the inability to recognize faces, typically present in younger children and to varying extents in different people, and as a result of brain damage to visual areas of the brain

#### pyramidal
the main type of neuron in the neocortex is the pyramid-shaped *pyramidal* neuron, which sends excitatory connections to other such neurons

#### receptors
typically refers to cells that serve to +transduce sensory signals into neural firing signals that can then be processed by the rest of the brain

#### relativity
another name for the +contrast principle, where neurons and the brain more generally is only sensitive to the relative differences between things, rather than their +absolute levels

#### sensation
refers to the raw sensory signals processed by the primary +receptors, as contrasted with +perception which refers to the deeper, interpretive processing of sensory information, which is closer to what we subjective experience

#### standardized
a measure or score that is has been +normalized into a standard range, for example IQ scores are typically standardized such that the average person has a score of 100

#### spike
the short-hand name for an +action-potential -- this is the electrical process that occurs when a +neuron gets sufficient +excitatory input to get over its +threshold

#### threshold
the level of excitation in a +neuron, above which it will fire a +spike, and below which it remains silent

#### transduce
to change or transform a signal from one form to another, as a +receptor does to sensory signals
