# Glossary

## A

#### absolute
is used in contrast with +relativity to refer to a value that is defined without reference to some other comparison -- e.g., absolute zero temperature is the lowest value for temperature, irrespective of any conventional scale on which temperature is measured.

#### adaptation
is a property of a +neuron where it tends to respond less vigorously over time to the same input stimulus.  This is an important aspect of +contrast as it causes neurons to respond to new things while ignoring older things.  It also refers to a similar process in sensory +receptors where they adjust their responses to stimuli over time.

#### addiction
is an informal term referring to a cluster of effects characterizing +dependence on a drug, typically measured in terms of +tolerance and the presence of +withdrawal-symptoms .

#### agnosia
is the lack of knowledge, often combined with a particular domain in which a person experiences this lack of knowledge, such as +prosopagnosia which is the lack of knowledge about faces (+prosocial agnosia).

#### anasagnosia
is the lack of knowledge about one's own lack of knowledge -- see +agnosia .

#### antisocial
is an attitude or behavior of acting against other people -- the opposite of +prosocial .

## C

#### classical conditioning
is the first type of conditioning-based learning described, famously by Pavlov and his salivating dogs, which involves the association of an initially arbitrary stimulus (i.e., the conditioned stimulus or CS) with some kind of meaningful positive or negative outcome (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus or US).  Compare with +instrumental-conditioning .

#### compression
is one of the three C's principles, reflecting the strong tendency of the brain to simplify or compress information, to the point that we can actually make sense of it.  This process starts in the individual +neuron .

#### consciousness
is the +subjective feeling of awareness of internal thoughts and perceptions.  The "hard" problem of consciousness is associated with its inherent subjectivity, meaning that it is beyond the reach of any objective +scientific-method and only truly accessible to individual human beings, ultimately only to *you*.  In the brain, conscious states are those associated with widespread patterns of activity across multiple brain areas. 

#### contrast
is one of the three C's principles, describing the focus on relative differences instead of absolute levels, e.g., relative vs. absolute auditory pitch, relative amounts of wealth, etc.  In the brain, +inhibitory +interneurons play an important role in making neurons have a +normalized response, by dividing away absolute levels.

## D

#### delta
is a math-based term for the amount of change or difference -- the principle of +contrast says we're particularly sensitive to deltas, rather than absolute levels.

#### delta rule
is a mathematical equation describing a type of learning based on the difference or error -- equivalent to the Rescorla Wagner rule that accounts for many phenomena in +classical-conditioning.

#### dependence
is the clinically preferred term for drug +addiction, typically involving +tolerance and +withdrawal-symptoms .

#### dopamine
is a major type of +neuromodulator that is widely but incorrectly thought to drive feelings of pleasure -- instead it signals the *difference* between a positive outcome (i.e., a +reward) compared to the +expectation of that reward, which is a +contrast based version of pleasure, as opposed to the absolute version.  As we come to expect something good, it loses some of its positive feeling -- this is closely related to the process of +tolerance in drug +addiction .

## E

#### excitatory
is something that causes positive effects, especially in a +neuron where some inputs are excitatory and cause the neuron to be more likely to fire a +spike -- the opposite of +inhibitory .

## H

#### hallucinogenic
means causing hallucinations, which are altered forms of perception, seeing things that are not really there.  Certain types of drugs including LSD are hallucinogenic, and act primarily on the +serotonin pathways in the brain.

#### hypnosis
is a state of extreme suggestibility, likely present in all people to varying extents, which can be enhanced through certain procedures by people trained in the art of hypnosis.  Roughly 1/3rd of people are readily susceptible to these hypnosis induction techniques.  It is currently not thought to be an altered state of +consciousness .

## I

#### inhibitory
in neuroscience, this means causing a neuron to be less excited, or less likely to fire a +spike .  More generally, can be anything that has an overall negative effect (on behavior, attitudes, etc) -- the opposite of +excitatory .

#### instrumental conditioning
is a type of conditioning involving reinforcing behaviors leading to different meaningful outcomes: positive outcomes result in an increase in the reinforced behavior, while negative outcomes have the opposite effect (Thorndike's law of effect).  Compare with +classical-conditioning which does not involve overt behavior.

#### interneuron
is a class of +neuron in the brain that are only locally connected to neighboring groups of neurons, as contrasted with +pyramidal neurons that are +excitatory .

## J

## K 

## L

## M

#### millisecond
is one thousandth (1/1000) of a second -- the fastest your brain can process information is roughly 200 milliseconds or 1/5 of a second.

#### motor
in neuroscience and psychology, refers to *muscles* and physical behavior produced by actually acting through muscle pathways.

## N

#### neuromodulator
is a type of +neurotransmitter that has broad, widespread effects throughout the brain, serving to modulate brain functioning.  for example, +dopamine can modulate the activity and rate of learning of neurons across wide areas of the brain.  +serotonin is another neuromodulator, involved in modulating arousal and mood states throughout the brain.

#### neuron
is the basic cell type in the brain that performs information processing via +compression of the roughly 10,000 input signals it receives, into a single spiking output that is broadcast to many other neurons.

#### neocortex
is the evolutionarily newest part of the brain, forming the outer-most layer, which is essential for all forms of cognition.

#### normalized
to re-scale (via either subtraction or division) a value into a "normal" or standard range, often the 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 range.  for example, if you subtract the mean from a set of values, they are 0-normalized.  if you then divide those values by the standard deviation, then they are called "normal" values or `z` scores.  see also +standardized

## O

## P

#### perception
the higher-level product of cortical-level +compression and +contrast processing of lower-level +sensation signals

#### photons
the particle-like manifestation of electromagnetic radiation (light), which activate the +rod and +cone +receptors in the eye to create visual +sensation

#### prediction
the process of generating an expectation or guess as to what will happen next.  see +predictive-learning

#### predictive learning
an important way in which the brain learns, based on the difference between a +prediction and what actually happens

#### prosocial
an attitude favoring social engagement and generally helping others -- the opposite of +antisocial

#### prosopagnosia
the inability to recognize faces, typically present in younger children and to varying extents in different people, and as a result of brain damage to visual areas of the brain

#### pyramidal
the main type of neuron in the neocortex is the pyramid-shaped *pyramidal* neuron, which sends excitatory connections to other such neurons

## R

#### receptors
typically refers to cells that serve to +transduce sensory signals into neural firing signals that can then be processed by the rest of the brain

#### relativity
another name for the +contrast principle, where neurons and the brain more generally is only sensitive to the relative differences between things, rather than their +absolute levels

## S

#### sensation
refers to the raw sensory signals processed by the primary +receptors, as contrasted with +perception which refers to the deeper, interpretive processing of sensory information, which is closer to what we subjective experience

#### serotonin
is a +neuromodulator that modulates arousal (wake vs. sleep) and mood, and is affected by +hallucinogenic drugs.  compared to +dopamine which can have rapid +phasic effects, serotonin is relatively longer and slower acting

#### standardized
a measure or score that is has been +normalized into a standard range, for example IQ scores are typically standardized such that the average person has a score of 100

#### stereotype
a simplified mental categorization of a group of people according to a set of properties, often used instead of trying to think about distinct and complex individuals, as a form of +compression that the brain automatically does.  some stereotypes are negative and can result in inaccurate negative impressions of individuals based on superficial characteristics that do not reflect their individual abilities and strengths.  given the widespread cultural spreading of stereotypes, even members of negatively stereotyped groups show at least implicit, and often explicit, incorporation of these beliefs

#### spike
the short-hand name for an +action-potential -- this is the electrical process that occurs when a +neuron gets sufficient +excitatory input to get over its +threshold

## T

#### threshold
the level of excitation in a +neuron, above which it will fire a +spike, and below which it remains silent

#### tolerance
the learning-based process resulting in the need for a higher level of drug consumption to produce the same effect -- in effect, the brain learns to expect the effect of the drug, reducing the +contrast between the expectation and the effect, which is what we actually experience

#### transduce
to change or transform a signal from one form to another, as a +receptor does to sensory signals

## U

## V

## W

#### withdrawal symptoms
are adverse feelings and physiological reactions in the body and brain associated with the withdrawal of a drug of +dependence .  in the case of +heroin, these symptoms can become quite severe, as depicted in various movies

## X

## Y

## Z
