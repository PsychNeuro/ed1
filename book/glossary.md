# Glossary

## A

#### absolute
is used in contrast with +relativity to refer to a value that is defined without reference to some other comparison --- e.g., absolute zero temperature is the lowest value for temperature, irrespective of any conventional scale on which temperature is measured.

#### action potential
is the output signal of a +neuron --- also known as a +spike --- which is driven by special +channels that propagate an electrical signal along the +axon to communicate to other neurons.

#### adaptation
is a property of a +neuron where it tends to respond less vigorously over time to the same input stimulus.  This is an important aspect of +contrast as it causes neurons to respond to new things while ignoring older things.  It also refers to a similar process in sensory +receptors where they adjust their responses to stimuli over time.

#### addiction
is an informal term referring to a cluster of effects characterizing +dependence on a drug, typically measured in terms of +tolerance and the presence of +withdrawal-symptoms.

#### agnosia
is the lack of knowledge, often combined with a particular domain in which a person experiences this lack of knowledge, such as +prosopagnosia which is the lack of knowledge about faces ( +prosocial agnosia).

#### AMPA
is the main type of +excitatory +channels on a +neuron, activated by +glutamate, and allowing sodium (Na+) +ions to enter the receiving neuron and thus increasing the positive charge.

#### amygdala
is the "almond shaped" +subcortical brain area most important for processing emotionally-relevant signals, including fear and reward.  It is the primary locus of the learning involved in +classical-conditioning, where initially neutral +CSs are associated with emotionally-significant +USs.

#### anasagnosia
is the lack of knowledge or +agnosia about one's own lack of knowledge --- i.e., a double form of +agnosia.

#### antisocial
is an attitude or behavior of acting against other people --- the opposite of +prosocial.

#### anxiety
is a state of fear.  Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent, at nearly 7% of the US population, and include *generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)*, *panic disorder*, and specific *phobias* (e.g., fear of snakes, etc).

#### arousal
refers to the overall level of activation of the brain, as along the continuum between sleep and wakefulness, and different levels of alertness and engagement.

#### attention
is the focusing of cognitive processing on a subset of information, to the exclusion of other things.  In the brain, it emerges through +inhibitory +interneurons that drive a competitive dynamic over the very limited capacity of attention, and a combination of bottom-up (from the sensory inputs) and top-down (from internal states and goals) signals that help shape what is attended to.

#### axon
is the output side of the +neuron that propagates the +action-potential.  Longer-range axons have +myelin sheaths that act like the insulation on a wire to speed the propagation of these signals.

## B

#### basal ganglia
(BG) are a collection of +subcortical brain areas that are densely interconnected with the [frontal cortex](#frontal-cortex) and are important for selecting the next action (+motor or purely cognitive).  The BG are strongly modulated by +dopamine, which drives +instrumental-conditioning in this area.  The primary input area is the *striatum* (*caudate* and *putamen*), which then goes to the *globus pallidus* and ultimately to the +thalamus which connects back to cortex and out to other subcortical motor areas.

#### behaviorism
is a school of psychology that was dominant during the period of 1900 -- 1950, which restricted study strictly to the +objective measurement of behavior, in contrast to the +subjective +introspection that was dominant previously.

## C

#### cerebellum
is the "mini brain" +subcortical brain area containing roughly half of the neurons in the brain, which learns through error signals to improve +motor actions, making them smoother and more efficient.

#### channels
are the tiny openings in a +neuron that allow +ions to flow in and out, driving the electrical processing in a neuron to integrate incoming information at +synapses, ultimately resulting in +compression and +contrast.

#### classical conditioning
is the first type of conditioning-based learning described famously by Pavlov and his salivating dogs, which involves the association of an initially arbitrary stimulus (i.e., the conditioned stimulus or +CSs) with some kind of inherently meaningful positive or negative outcome (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus or +USs).  Compare with +instrumental-conditioning.

#### cognitive
refers to cognition or "thinking", and more specifically to the nature of the mental processes underlying specific forms of cognition.

#### cognitivism
is the +paradigm of psychology that followed +behaviorism, overcoming the objection to studying internal mental states in part by adopting information processing models based on the computer technologies emerging in the 1960's.  Thus, this field focused on the +cognitive processes such as memory, problem solving, and language comprehension that have counterparts in the computer world.

#### compression
is one of the three C's principles, reflecting the strong tendency of the brain to simplify or compress information, to the point that we can actually make sense of it.  This process starts in the individual +neuron.

#### cones
are the color-sensitive +receptors in the +retina predominantly located in the central +fovea and surrounding visual field.  There are three different color sensitivities: low frequency (red), medium frequency (green), and high frequency (blue), and all of the colors of the rainbow are encoded as different mixtures of these three primary colors.

#### consciousness
is the +subjective feeling of awareness of internal thoughts and perceptions.  The "hard" problem of consciousness is associated with its inherent subjectivity, meaning that it is beyond the reach of any +objective +scientific-method and only truly accessible to individual human beings, ultimately only to *you*.  In the brain, conscious states are those associated with widespread patterns of activity across multiple brain areas. 

#### constancy
is a property of +perception where we perceive the stable underlying state of the world (e.g., the true color and size of objects), not the raw +sensory signals --- it is an aspect of +compression and likely depends on +predictive-learning.

#### contrast
is one of the three C's principles, describing the focus on relative differences instead of absolute levels, e.g., relative vs. absolute auditory pitch, relative amounts of wealth, etc.  In the brain, the +inhibitory +interneuron plays an important role in making neurons have a +normalized response, by dividing away absolute levels.

#### CSs
are *conditioned stimuli* --- initially neutral stimuli that become associated with +USs through +classical-conditioning.

## D

#### delta
is a math-based term for the amount of change or difference --- the principle of +contrast says we're particularly sensitive to deltas, rather than absolute levels.

#### delta rule
is a mathematical equation describing a type of learning based on the difference or error --- equivalent to the Rescorla Wagner rule that accounts for many phenomena in +classical-conditioning.

#### dendrites
are tree-like branches of a +neuron where +synapses receive signals from other neurons --- this is the input side of a +neuron.

#### dependence
is the clinically preferred term for drug +addiction, typically involving +tolerance and +withdrawal-symptoms.

#### depression
is a widespread mental disorder, formally known as *major depressive disorder*, characterized by an extended period lasting 2 weeks or longer with symptoms of *depressed mood* (sadness) and *anhedonia* (inability to experience pleasure).

#### dopamine
is a major type of +neuromodulator that is widely but incorrectly thought to drive feelings of pleasure --- instead it signals the *difference* between a positive outcome (i.e., a +reward) compared to the +expectation of that reward, which is a +contrast based version of pleasure, as opposed to the absolute version.  As we come to expect something good, it loses some of its positive feeling --- this is closely related to the process of +tolerance in drug +addiction.

#### dualism
is when there are two fundamentally incompatible things that cannot be directly connected to each other.  For example classical substance dualism holds that the mind is effectively an entirely distinct substance from the brain, and that you can never fully explain the mind in terms of the brain.  See +perspective-dualism for a different way of understanding this dualism between mind and brain, that doesn't require mind to be a distinct substance, thus avoiding difficult questions regarding how it might exist in the physical universe.

## E

#### EEG
is *electroencephalography* --- the use of electrical signals typically recorded at the scalp to measure and infer patterns of underlying neural activity.  It has the advantage of very fast temporal precision in the millisecond scale, but relatively poor spatial resolution compared to +fMRI and other +neuroimaging techniques.

#### empiricism
is the philosophical approach to +epistemology that argues that much of human knowledge comes from experience-based learning.

#### epistemology
is the study and philosophy of the nature and origins of knowledge.  Historically, some thought that knowledge came from logical reasoning ( +rationalism) while others thought that it came from experience in the world ( +empiricism).  Both are very likely to be important contributors, but the nature of the underlying learning processes are not fully resolved (see Chapter 5).

#### excitatory
is something that causes positive effects, especially in a +neuron where some inputs are excitatory and cause the neuron to be more likely to fire a +spike --- the opposite of +inhibitory.

## F

#### fixation
refers to maintaining the eyes in one place while processing the information at that location.  It lasts about 200 +milliseconds before the next [saccade](#saccades).

#### fMRI
is *functional magnetic resonance imaging*, which uses an MRI machine to measure the oxegenation status of blood (known as the BOLD response), which in turn reflects underlying neural activity to a remarkable degree of spatial precision (e.g., 1 millimeter).  It is the most widely used +neuroimaging technique in people, and has been essential in understanding the neural basis of human cognition and behavior.

#### fovea
is the central region of the +retina containing predominantly +cones that supports high-resolution color vision.  We are constantly moving our eyes through +saccades to focus the fovea on regions of interest.

#### frontal cortex
is the front part of the +neocortex, responsible for +motor actions and higher-level +control over all aspects of behavior and cognition.  It functions in extensive interconnection with the +basal-ganglia.

## G

#### GABA
is the name of the primary type of +inhibitory +neurotransmitter in the brain, and also the name of the +channels activated thereby.  The channels allow chloride (Cl-) +ions to enter the +neuron, resulting in increased negative charge.

#### glutamate
is the main +excitatory +neurotransmitter in the brain, released by +pyramidal neurons in the +neocortex, and activating +AMPA +channels on the receiving +neuron.

## H

#### hallucinogenic
means causing hallucinations, which are altered forms of perception, seeing things that are not really there.  Certain types of drugs including LSD are hallucinogenic, and act primarily on the +serotonin pathways in the brain.

#### hypnosis
is a state of extreme suggestibility, likely present in all people to varying extents, which can be enhanced through certain procedures by people trained in the practice.  Roughly 1/3rd of people are readily susceptible to these hypnosis induction techniques.  It is not thought to be an altered state of +consciousness.

## I

#### implicit
refers to processes that operate in the brain below the level of +consciousness --- i.e., +subconscious processes.  The opposite of +explicit processes or +declarative knowledge.

#### inhibitory
in neuroscience, this means causing a neuron to be less excited, or less likely to fire a +spike.  More generally, can be anything that has an overall negative effect (on behavior, attitudes, etc) --- the opposite of +excitatory.

#### instrumental conditioning
is a type of conditioning involving reinforcing behaviors leading to different meaningful outcomes: positive outcomes result in an increase in the reinforced behavior, while negative outcomes have the opposite effect (Thorndike's law of effect).  Compare with +classical-conditioning which does not involve overt behavior.

#### interneuron
is a class of +neuron in the brain that are only locally connected to neighboring groups of neurons, and are most often +inhibitory, as contrasted with +pyramidal neurons that are +excitatory.  Inhibitory interneurons release +GABA that activate +postsynaptic +channels of the same name.

#### introspection
is the process of "looking within" one's own mental states and attempting to report on them.  This was one of the first methods used in psychology, by Willhelm Wundt, and the +behaviorism approach that followed represents a rejection of any attempt to deal with +subjective mental states.

#### ions
are charged atoms such as sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and potassium (K+) that power the electrical processing within a +neuron.

## J

## K 

## L

## M

#### millisecond
is one thousandth (1/1000) of a second --- the fastest your brain can process information is roughly 200 milliseconds or 1/5 of a second.

#### model
refers to an internal +representation of something else, typically in the external environment.  An internal model allows one to simulate the effects of different possible actions, for example, and is thus important for enabling more intelligent behavior.

#### motor
refers to *muscles* and physical behavior produced by actually acting through muscle pathways.

#### myelin
is an insulating sheath around the +axon that speeds the propagation of the electrical +action-potential to communicate with other neurons.  Myelination occurs progressively over the course of development, and is removed in multiple sclerosis. 

## N

#### neuroimaging
consists if a range of different techniques for measuring the state of the brain, including +fMRI, +EEG, and +PET.

#### neuromodulator
is a type of +neurotransmitter that has broad, widespread effects throughout the brain, serving to modulate brain functioning.  For example, +dopamine can modulate the activity and rate of learning of neurons across wide areas of the brain.  +serotonin is another neuromodulator, involved in modulating arousal and mood states throughout the brain.

#### neurotransmitter
is a chemical that is released in tiny containers (called vesicles) from the +presynaptic side of +synapses in response to the +action-potential, starting the process of neural communication from one +neuron to the next.

#### neuron
is the basic cell type in the brain that performs information processing via +compression of the roughly 10,000 input signals it receives on its +dendrites into a single +spike output on its +axon that is broadcast to many other neurons.

#### neocortex
is the evolutionarily newest part of the brain, forming the outer-most layer, which is essential for all forms of cognition.

#### normalized
re-scaled (via either subtraction or division) value into a "normal" or standard range, often the 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 range.  For example, if you subtract the mean from a set of values, they are 0-normalized.  If you then divide those values by the standard deviation, then they are called "normal" values or `z` scores.  See also +standardized.

## O

#### objective
is the opposite of +subjective -- the attempt to construct an understanding of the world from a "third person" perspective, beyond the limits of one's own subjective window onto it.  Although +perception gives us the feeling of seeing the world as it is, objectively, in fact everything we see and experience is inevitably filtered through our own subjective perspective, and thus it is impossible to directly obtain an objective understanding.  Nevertheless, we can incrementally work toward developing some kind of stable, consensus of understanding among people who choose to abide by the +scientific-method.

#### OCD
is *obsessive compulsive disorder*, which is characterized by repeated thoughts typically focused on negative potential outcomes, and compulsive, repeated behaviors taken to try to avoid these negative outcomes.

#### olfaction
is the sensory modality of smell, conveyed through chemical receptors in the nose.

## P

#### paradigm
refers to an influential set of interconnected theories and data that many individual scientists believe in at a given point in time.  In psychology, examples include the paradigms of +behaviorism and +cognitivism.  Thomas Khun established the paradigm as a way of understanding the nature of scientific progress, which can get stuck in a paradigm, until enough evidence accumulates to overthrow it.

#### perception
is the higher-level product of cortical-level +compression and +contrast processing of lower-level +sensation signals, resulting in an encoding of the stable underlying state of the world that factors out incidental differences to a large extent: we see the world, not our raw sensory signals.  For example, in vision, we perceive the underlying material color, not the raw color of light hitting our eyes, and we see the expected real size of something, not how big of a region it activates on our +retina --- these are also known as color and size +constancy.

#### perspective dualism
is a form of +dualism between the +subjective and +objective perspectives.  Each person has their own unique subjective experience of what it feels like to be their own physical brain, and because each such subjective perspective arises from a different physical brain, necessarily, it is impossible for two people to ever directly share the same subjective experience.  Thus, subjective experience remains uniquely individual, and thus forever outside the realm of something that can be defined objectively, because objectivity is based on what can be shared and replicated across people.

#### PET
is *positron emission tomography*, which uses the emission of pairs of +photons generated indirectly via radioactive decay to image the brain.  It is uniquely capable of imaging specific chemicals which can be tagged with radioactive labels, but it has relatively poor spatial and temporal resolution compared to other +neuroimaging techniques.

#### photons
are the particle-like manifestation of electromagnetic radiation (light), which activate the +rods and +cones in the eyes to create visual +sensation.

#### postsynaptic
is the receiving side of +synapses, which has +channels such as +AMPA and +GABA that are activated by +neurotransmitter release.

#### prediction
is the process of generating an expectation or guess as to what will happen next, as in +predictive-learning --- this can be a largely +implicit +subconscious process.

#### predictive learning
is an important way in which the brain learns, based on the difference between a +prediction and what actually happens, which is known to be important for producing a stable perception of the world even though our eyes are constantly moving through +saccades.

#### presynaptic
is the sending side of +synapses, where +neurotransmitter is released at the +terminal-button.

#### prosocial
is an attitude favoring social engagement and generally helping others --- the opposite of +antisocial

#### prosopagnosia
is the inability to recognize faces, typically present in younger children and to varying extents in different people, and occuring as a result of brain damage to specific visual areas of the brain known to be specialized for processing faces.

#### pyramidal
is the main type of +excitatory +neuron in the +neocortex, named for its pyramid-shaped body.  It releases the excitatory +neurotransmitter +glutamate at its +terminal-button that activates +AMPA +channels.

## Q

#### qualia
is the +subjective feeling of experiences --- what it *feels like* to experience something, like tasting an apple or seeing the color red.  

## R

#### rationalism
is the philosophical approach to +epistemology that argues that much of human knowledge comes from logical reasoning.

#### receptors
are cells that serve to +transduce sensory signals into neural firing signals that can then be processed by the rest of the brain.

#### relativity
is another name for the +contrast principle, where there is sensitivity only to the relative differences between things, rather than their +absolute levels.

#### replicable
refers to whether an experiment can be repeated by following a well-specified procedure, and reliably produces the same pattern of data.  There is a *replication crisis* in a number of scientific fields including psychology, neuroscience and medicine due to a large number of published studies failing to replicate (see Chapter 1 for more discussion).

#### representation
is an internal pattern of neural activity that encodes information.  Representations are thus the basic elements of neural processing in the brain, and understanding the nature of these representations is a major ongoing focus of scientific research.

#### retina
is the light-sensitive part of our eyes, composed of +rods and +cones +receptors that +transduce +photons into electrical signals that drive further neural activity into the brain.

#### rods
are the *monochromatic* (non color sensitive) +receptors in the +retina covering the entire visual field, including the peripheral area --- these are much more sensitive to low levels of light compared to +cones and thus dominate for night vision.

## S

#### saccades
are the constant movements of the eyes to focus the +fovea of the +retina onto a target point in space.  Each +fixation of the eyes lasts about 200 +milliseconds (1/5 of a second) and it takes roughly 50-100 milliseconds to move the eyes.

#### schizophrenia
is a relatively rare mental disorder characterized by *positive symptoms* such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with *negative symptoms* that resemble those of +depression and +anxiety.

#### scientific method
is a procedure for establishing +replicable results from experiments that can build up a body of understanding that transcends the individual's +subjective experience and works toward establishing an +objective understanding of the world.  Critical elements include formulating a hypothesis, testing it by collecting data using a well-specified procedure that can be reliably replicated by others, and analyzing the data to determine if it confirmed or disconfirmed the hypothesis.

#### sensation
refers to the raw signals produced by the primary +receptors, as contrasted with +perception which refers to the deeper, interpretive processing of sensory information.  We are not aware of raw sensation.

#### serotonin
is a +neuromodulator that modulates +arousal (wake vs. sleep) and mood, and is affected by +hallucinogenic drugs.  Compared to +dopamine which can have rapid +phasic effects, serotonin is relatively longer and slower acting.

#### standardized
refers to a measure or score that is has been +normalized into a standard range, for example IQ scores are typically standardized such that the average person has a score of 100.

#### stereotype
is a simplified mental categorization of a group of people according to a set of properties, often used instead of trying to think about distinct and complex individuals, as a form of +compression that the brain automatically does.  Some stereotypes are negative and can result in inaccurate negative impressions of individuals based on superficial characteristics that do not reflect their individual abilities and strengths.  Given the widespread cultural spreading of stereotypes, even members of negatively stereotyped groups show at least implicit, and often explicit, incorporation of these beliefs.

#### spike
is a short-hand name for an +action-potential --- this is the electrical process that occurs when a +neuron gets sufficient +excitatory input to get over its firing +threshold to send a signal to other neurons.

#### subconscious
refers to processes operating below the level of +consciousness, as famously emphasized by Sigmund Freud.  See also +implicit.

#### subcortical
refers to all the brain areas below the level of the +neocortex, including the +thalamus, +basal-ganglia, +amygdala, +cerebellum among others.

#### subjective
the first-person perspective, available only to *you*.  The fact that only each individual can have a subjective experience raises fundamental challenges for any attempt to achieve an +objective understanding of the *mind*, which is inexorably tied to the subjective experience of *being* a brain.  Given that psychology is essentially the study of the mind, this poses fundamental challenges for the field.

#### synapses
are the connections between neurons where the +action-potential arriving from the sending neuron causes the release of +neurotransmitter that then opens +channels on the receiving neuron's +dendrites, resulting in either +excitatory or +inhibitory effects depending on whether the sending neuron is an excitatory +pyramidal neuron or an inhibitory +interneuron.

## T

#### terminal button
is the end of an +axon that forms the sending, +presynaptic side of +synapses, where +neurotransmitter is released in response to an +action-potential.

#### thalamus
is a +subcortical brain area located internal to the +neocortex, with which it is extensively interconnected, providing widespread control over +arousal, and +control via its interconnectivity with the +basal-ganglia and +frontal-cortex.  All sensory modalities except +olfaction route their signals through the thalamus on the way to the +neocortex.  It may also be important for +predictive-learning.

#### threshold
is the level of +excitation in a +neuron, above which it will fire an +action-potential, and below which it remains silent.

#### tolerance
is the learning-based process resulting in the need for a higher level of drug consumption to produce the same effect.  The brain learns to expect the effect of the drug, reducing the +contrast relative to this expectation.

#### transduce
means to change or transform a signal from one form to another, as +receptors do to +sensory signals.

## U

#### USs
are *unconditioned stimuli* which evoke emotionally salient internal states such as reward or pain, and serve as the critical learning signals in both +classical-conditioning and +instrumental conditioning.

## V

## W

#### withdrawal symptoms
are adverse feelings and physiological reactions in the body and brain associated with the withdrawal of a drug of +dependence.  In the case of heroin, these symptoms can become quite severe, as depicted in various movies.

## X

## Y

## Z
