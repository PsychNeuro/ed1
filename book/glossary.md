# Glossary

## A

##### absolute
is used in contrast with +relativity to refer to a value that is defined without reference to some other comparison --- e.g., absolute zero temperature is the lowest value for temperature, irrespective of any conventional scale on which temperature is measured.

##### action potential
is the output signal of a +neuron --- also known as a +spike --- which is driven by special +channels that propagate an electrical signal along the +axon to communicate to other neurons.

##### acetylcholine
(ACh) is a +neuromodulator released by the *basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei* that modulates attention, arousal and learning --- it is affected by nicotine.  It is also the primary +neurotransmitter at the *neuromuscular junction* where nerve signals activate muscles.

##### adaptation
is a property of a +neuron where it tends to respond less vigorously over time to the same input stimulus.  This is an important aspect of +contrast as it causes neurons to respond to new things while ignoring older things.  It also refers to a similar process in sensory +receptors where they adjust their responses to stimuli over time.

##### addiction
is an informal term referring to a cluster of effects characterizing +dependence on a drug, typically measured in terms of +tolerance and the presence of +withdrawal-symptoms.

##### ADHD
stands for *attention deficit hyperactivity disorder*, which is a developmental disorder characterized by two distinct dominant symptoms: difficulty sustaining attention, and hyperactivity (inability to sit still).  It is often treated using +stimulants such as +amphetamine or +methylphenidate.  See [@sec:ch-disorders] for more details.

##### adrenaline
is a +hormone that is released by the +sympathetic-nervous-system in response to acute stressors, to prepare for "fight or flight" responses.

##### agnosia
is the lack of knowledge, often combined with a particular domain in which a person experiences this lack of knowledge, such as +prosopagnosia which is the lack of knowledge about faces (+prosocial agnosia).

##### agonists
are chemicals that facilitate or activate a given +neurotransmitter pathway, as compared to +antagonists.  There are many different possible biological mechanisms, including direct binding to a target +receptor, increasing the release of neurotransmitter, blocking +reuptake, etc.

##### AI
is *artificial intelligence* --- capturing some level of human intelligence in an artificial system.  This is a long-held goal of many, but current examples exhibit very *narrow* forms of intelligence, such as the ability to play one, and only one, type of game.  There are no existing artificial systems that come close to matching the generality and flexibility of human intelligence: the goal of *artificial general intelligence* (AGI) is to do so.

##### algorithm
is a specific procedure for solving a problem, usually used in the context of computer programs that implement such procedures.  For example, there are many different ways to sort a list of items in alphabetical order --- each of these is a different algorithm (bubble sort, heap sort, etc), with different characteristic properties that can be analyzed independent of any particular +program that implements the algorithm.

##### amnesia
is the inability to form new memories (technically known as *anterograde* amnesia), or retrieve existing ones (*retrograde* amnesia), specifically used to refer to +episodic memories encoded by the +hippocampus.

##### AMPA
is the main type of +excitatory +channels on a +neuron, activated by +glutamate, and allowing sodium (Na+) +ions to enter the receiving neuron and thus increasing the positive charge.

##### amphetamine
is an +agonist on the +dopamine and +norepinephrine pathways, producing +stimulant effects on behavior and mood.

##### amygdala
is the "almond shaped" +subcortical brain area most important for processing emotionally-relevant signals, including fear and reward.  It is the primary locus of the learning involved in +classical-conditioning, where initially neutral +CSs are associated with emotionally-significant +USs.

##### anasagnosia
is the lack of knowledge or +agnosia about one's own lack of knowledge --- i.e., a double form of +agnosia.

##### antagonists
are chemicals that block or inhibit a given +neurotransmitter pathway, as compared to +agonists.  There are many different possible biological mechanisms, including blocking release or blocking / inhibiting the target +receptor.

##### anterior
is an anatomical term that refers to the **front** portion of a structure, which is the opposite of +posterior.

##### antisocial
is an attitude or behavior of acting against other people --- the opposite of +prosocial.

##### anxiety
is a state of fear.  Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent, at nearly 7% of the US population, and include *generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)*, *panic disorder*, and specific *phobias* (e.g., fear of snakes, etc).

##### arousal
refers to the overall level of activation of the brain, as along the continuum between sleep and wakefulness, and different levels of alertness and engagement.

##### attention
is the focusing of cognitive processing on a subset of information, to the exclusion of other things.  In the brain, it emerges through the +inhibitory +interneuron driven competition to become active and enter into the very limited capacity of attention, and a combination of +bottom-up (from the sensory inputs) and +top-down (from internal states and goals) signals that help shape what is attended to.

##### autism
is a developmental disorder that is extremely diverse, and characterized along a *spectrum* of severity, with many people suffering from incapacitating symptoms, while relatively fewer highly functional and even super-functional *savant* cases tend to be popularized in the media.  Typically, the ability to relate socially with others is impaired (including language issues), and often there are repetitive behaviors and thoughts, along with focused, narrow interests in particularly domains of knowledge.

##### autonomic
refers to the automatic, subconscious nervous system, comprised of the +sympathetic-nervous-system and the +parasympathetic-nervous-system, which work in opposition to support rapid mobilization of behavior in the case of threat vs. slower offline activities such as digestion and breeding.  The enteric nervous system associated with the digestive pathways is often considered a third element of the autonomic nervious system.  The +hypothalamus plays a major role in controlling this system.

##### axon
is the output side of the +neuron that propagates the +action-potential.  Longer-range axons have +myelin sheaths that act like the insulation on a wire to speed the propagation of these signals.

## B

##### backpropagation
is a method (+algorithm) for training a +neural-network to perform specific tasks, by directly adapting the +synapses (known as +weights)

##### basal ganglia
(BG) are a collection of +subcortical brain areas that are densely interconnected with the +frontal cortex and are important for selecting the next action (+motor or purely cognitive).  The BG are strongly modulated by +dopamine, which drives +instrumental-conditioning in this area.  The primary input area is the +striatum (*caudate*, *putamen*, and *nucleus accumbens*), which then goes to the *globus pallidus* and ultimately to the +thalamus which connects back to cortex and out to other subcortical motor areas.

##### behaviorism
is a school of psychology that was dominant during the period of 1900 -- 1950, which restricted study strictly to the +objective measurement of behavior, in contrast to the +subjective +introspection that was dominant previously.

##### benzodiazepines
are a class of drugs that act as +GABA +agonists, increasing the level of +inhibition in the brain, resulting in sedation, calming, and ultimately, unconsciousness.

##### bidirectional
means going in two directions, typically referring to connectivity in the brain, where there are connections from area A to area B, and also *reciprocal* connections back from B to A.  Often, these connections are organized in a +hierarchy in terms of +bottom-up or +feedforward connections going from the sensory inputs to higher areas, and +top-down or +feedback connections going from the higher level internal areas back down to lower, more sensory areas.

##### BIOS
is the *basic input output system* of a computer, which controls the physical hardware for interacting with the system.  By analogy, the +brainstem and +autonomic system are kind of like the "BIOS" of the body.

##### bottom-up
refers to connections in the brain that go from sensory to higher levels in a +hierarchy.

##### brainstem
refers to the bottom-most portion of the brain, adjacent to the spinal cord, which supports the most basic, essential regulation of the body.

## C

##### CAPTCHA
is an annoying test used on various websites to try to determine whether the user is a human or a "bot" --- it literally stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".  It is a kind of +AI test and also a way to generate data sets to train AI models.

##### causal
refers to a relationship where one factor or variable truly *causes* another, as opposed to a mere +correlation.

##### cerebellum
is the "mini brain" +subcortical brain area containing roughly half of the neurons in the brain, which learns through error signals to improve +motor actions, making them smoother and more efficient.

##### channels
are the tiny openings in a +neuron that allow +ions to flow in and out, driving the electrical processing in a neuron to integrate incoming information at +synapses, ultimately resulting in +compression and +contrast.

##### classical conditioning
is the first type of conditioning-based learning described famously by Pavlov and his salivating dogs, which involves the association of an initially arbitrary stimulus (i.e., the conditioned stimulus or +CSs) with some kind of inherently meaningful positive or negative outcome (i.e., the unconditioned stimulus or +USs).  Compare with +instrumental-conditioning.

##### cognitive
refers to cognition or "thinking", and more specifically to the nature of the mental processes underlying specific forms of cognition.

##### cognitivism
is the +paradigm of psychology that followed +behaviorism, overcoming the objection to studying internal mental states in part by adopting information processing models based on the computer technologies emerging in the 1960's.  Thus, this field focused on the +cognitive processes such as memory, problem solving, and language comprehension that have counterparts in the computer world.

##### cognitive dissonance
reflects attempts to maintain a consistent +self-model, in the face of discrepancies between actual behavior and this internal model of the self.  For example, people will overestimate their interest in a boring task when paid little to perform it, compared to when they are well-compensated.  See [@sec:ch-soc] for more discussion.

##### comorbid
refers to multiple distinct diseases co-occurring at the same time.  The "morbid" part does not mean that people die --- in medical terminology, it just refers to the occurrence of a disease.

##### compression
is one of the three C's principles, reflecting the strong tendency of the brain to simplify or compress information, to the point that we can actually make sense of it.  This process starts in the individual +neuron, which receives thousands of inputs and only communicates one output signal.

##### cones
are the color-sensitive +receptors in the +retina predominantly located in the central +fovea and surrounding visual field.  There are three different color sensitivities: low frequency (red), medium frequency (green), and high frequency (blue), and all of the colors of the rainbow are encoded as different mixtures of these three primary colors.

##### confederate
is a person who appears to be a random participant in an +experiment, but is actually part of the research team, and performs specified behaviors needed to accomplish the study objectives.

##### confound
is a difference between the different conditions of an +experiment, which can act as a +third-variable and thus undermine the interpretation of a +causal connection.  It is challenging but essential to eliminate as many such confounds as possible, and doing so is part of the learned art of experimental psychology.

##### consciousness
is the +subjective feeling of awareness of internal thoughts and perceptions.  The "hard" problem of consciousness is associated with its inherent subjectivity, meaning that it is beyond the reach of any +objective +scientific-method and only truly accessible to individual human beings, ultimately only to *you*.  In the brain, conscious states are those associated with widespread patterns of activity across multiple brain areas. 

##### constancy
is a property of +perception where we perceive the stable underlying state of the world (e.g., the true color and size of objects), not the raw +sensory signals --- it is an aspect of +compression and likely depends on +predictive-learning.

##### contrast
is one of the three C's principles, describing the focus on relative differences instead of absolute levels, e.g., relative vs. absolute auditory pitch, relative amounts of wealth, etc.  In the brain, the +inhibitory +interneuron plays an important role in making neurons have a +normalized response, by dividing away absolute levels.

##### correlation
is a measure of the relationship ("co-relation") between two +variables.  The standard statistic is Pearson's *r* value, which is 0 for completely uncorrelated variables,  -1 for a perfect negative correlation (the two variables move perfectly in the opposite direction), and +1 for a perfect positive correlation (the two variables move perfectly in the same direction).  The +third-variable problem prevents us from concluding that a correlation implies causation, but our brains like to draw that conclusion anyway.

##### corticosteroids
are +hormones released in response to stress, that help mobilize the body's responses to prepare for bad things such as injury or sickness.  Chronic elevation of these corticosteroids (due to chronic stress) can exhaust the body and leave it more susceptible to infection, and can impair the function of brain systems including the +hippocampus.  This is a major way in which different environmental conditions between poor and wealthy people can have significant affects on brain and body.

##### counterfactual
means "against the facts" --- typically used to describe scenarios that test reasoning and belief systems, but can be problematic because they are by definition not realistic.

##### CPU
is the *central processing unit* in a standard digital computer architecture, which supports basic arithmetic, logic, memory, and control operations via an *instruction set*.  By enabling arbitrary sequences of such basic operations to be performed on arbitrary data, a CPU can accomplish *any* type of information processing function: it is a *universal* computational device.

##### CSs
are *conditioned stimuli* --- initially neutral stimuli that become associated with +USs through +classical-conditioning.

## D

##### delta
is a math-based term for the amount of change or difference --- the principle of +contrast says we're particularly sensitive to deltas, rather than absolute levels.

##### delta rule
is a mathematical equation describing a type of learning based on the difference or error --- equivalent to the Rescorla Wagner rule that accounts for many phenomena in +classical-conditioning.

##### dendrites
are tree-like branches of a +neuron where +synapses receive signals from other neurons --- this is the input side of a +neuron.

##### dependence
is the clinically preferred term for drug +addiction, typically involving +tolerance and +withdrawal-symptoms.

##### dependent variable
is a +variable measured in an +experiment, as opposed to being manipulated.

##### depression
is a widespread mental disorder, formally known as *major depressive disorder*, characterized by an extended period lasting 2 weeks or longer with symptoms of *depressed mood* (sadness) and *anhedonia* (inability to experience pleasure).

##### DNA
is *Deoxyribonucleic acid*, which encodes the genetic instructions for all forms of life, using 4 different *base pairs*, G, C, T, and A, which interconnect in the shape of a *double helix*.

##### dopamine
is a major type of +neuromodulator that is widely but incorrectly thought to drive feelings of pleasure --- instead it signals the *difference* between a positive outcome (i.e., a +reward) compared to the +expectation of that reward, which is a +contrast based version of pleasure, as opposed to the absolute version.  As we come to expect something good, it loses some of its positive feeling --- this is closely related to the process of +tolerance in drug +addiction.

##### dorsal
is an anatomical term that refers to the **upper** portion of a brain structure (think of the dorsal fin on a dolphin), which is the opposite of +ventral.

##### dualism
is when there are two fundamentally incompatible things that cannot be directly connected to each other.  For example classical substance dualism holds that the mind is effectively an entirely distinct substance from the brain, and that you can never fully explain the mind in terms of the brain.  See +perspective-dualism for a different way of understanding this dualism between mind and brain, that doesn't require mind to be a distinct substance, thus avoiding difficult questions regarding how it might exist in the physical universe.

## E

##### EEG
is *electroencephalography* --- the use of electrical signals typically recorded at the scalp to measure and infer patterns of underlying neural activity.  It has the advantage of very fast temporal precision in the millisecond scale, but relatively poor spatial resolution compared to +fMRI and other +neuroimaging techniques.

##### emergence
is the phenomenon where something fundamentally new arises from interacting elements, as illustrated in [@fig:fig-gears] in [@sec:ch-neuro] (the gears interacting).  Because an interaction depends on each element that is interacting, it cannot be reduced to either in isolation.  The billions of neurons interacting in the brain create the potential for huge amounts of emergence, enabling the mind to +transcend its biological substrate in the brain.

##### empiricism
is the philosophical approach to +epistemology that argues that much of human knowledge comes from experience-based learning.

##### endogenous
refers to normally-occuring, "natural" things in the body or brain.  For example, the brain naturally releases +opioids, which are thus called *endogenous opioids*, as contrasted with the kind you get from consuming drugs.

##### epilepsy
is a brain disorder affecting about 4% of people at some point in their lives, characterized by periodic *seizures* where excessive neural activity cascades through the brain, often causing a person to lose control of their muscles or even lose consciousness. Treatment involves increasing +inhibition, for example through +GABA +agonists.

##### episodic
refers to something that happened within a single *episode* or *event* --- most often used to describe the type of memories encoded by the +hippocampus.

##### epistemology
is the study and philosophy of the nature and origins of knowledge.  Historically, some thought that knowledge came from logical reasoning (+rationalism) while others thought that it came from experience in the world (+empiricism).  Both are very likely to be important contributors, but the nature of the underlying learning processes are not fully resolved (see [@sec:ch-learn]).

##### excitatory
is something that causes positive effects, especially in a +neuron where some inputs are excitatory and cause the neuron to be more likely to fire a +spike --- the opposite of +inhibitory.

##### experiment
is a type of scientific study employing *random assignment* of +participants to conditions to attempt to avoid the +third-variable problem.  It provides the best form of evidence for a +causal relationship.

## F

##### feedback
is a pattern of neural connectivty or flow of information going in the "backward" or +top-down direction in the +hierarchy of brain areas.  See also +recurrent.

##### feedforward
is a pattern of neural connectivity or flow of information going in the "forward" or +bottom-up direction in the +hierarchy of brain areas.  Compare with +bidirectional, where information can flow both bottom-up and +top-down, as happens in the +neocortex.

##### fixation
refers to maintaining the eyes in one place while processing the information at that location.  It lasts about 200 +milliseconds before the next [saccade](#saccades).

##### fMRI
is *functional magnetic resonance imaging*, which uses an MRI machine to measure the oxegenation status of blood (known as the BOLD response), which in turn reflects underlying neural activity to a remarkable degree of spatial precision (e.g., 1 millimeter).  It is the most widely used +neuroimaging technique in people, and has been essential in understanding the neural basis of human cognition and behavior.

##### fovea
is the central region of the +retina containing predominantly +cones that supports high-resolution color vision.  We are constantly moving our eyes through +saccades to focus the fovea on regions of interest.

##### frontal
is the front part of the +neocortex, responsible for +motor actions and higher-level +control over all aspects of behavior and cognition.  It functions in extensive interconnection with the +basal-ganglia.  See also +prefrontal cortex.

## G

##### GABA
is the name of the primary type of +inhibitory +neurotransmitter in the brain, and also the name of the +channels activated thereby.  The channels allow chloride (Cl-) +ions to enter the +neuron, resulting in increased negative charge.

##### glia
are support cells in the brain, which outnumber neurons, and play a number of important roles in regulating and optimizing brain function, including one specialized type that provides the insulating +myelin sheath.

##### glutamate
is the main +excitatory +neurotransmitter in the brain, released by +pyramidal neurons in the +neocortex, and activating +AMPA +channels on the receiving +neuron.

## H

##### hallucinogenic
means causing hallucinations, which are altered forms of perception, seeing things that are not really there.  Certain types of drugs including LSD are hallucinogenic, and act primarily on the +serotonin pathways in the brain.

##### hierarchy
refers to a type of organization with a clearly organized ranking into different "vertical" levels (e.g., as in a company or military organization with clearly delineated levels of management or command).  In the human brain, there is a hierarchy of processing in sensory areas, going from lower-level areas receiving direct sensory input, to higher-level areas where the sensory information has been highly [compressed](#compression).

##### hippocampus
is a brain structure that learns very quickly and can thus encode +episodic memories as they happen.  People without a functioning hippocampus, such as the famous patient H.M., were unable to form these memories (i.e., +amnesia), but still could recall older episodic memories from before their hippocampus was damaged.

#### homolog
is used to refer to a brain area in one species that maps onto the "same" brain area in a different species.

#### homunculus
literally means "little person" and it is used to refer to the internal map of the body found in primary somatosensory and +motor cortex.  It is also sometimes used to refer to the idea that you need an entire person inside a given brain area to accomplish the functions attributed to that area, e.g., in the case of "executive function" which pretty much requires a little executive sitting in your +prefrontal cortex to get the job done.

##### hormone
is a chemical produced in one area (e.g., the brain) that can produce effects in other areas of the body.  Metaphorically, it is like a +neurotransmitter but instead of communicating between neurons, it supports communication between different parts of the body.  The +hypothalamus is the most important control area in the brain for hormone release, as part of the +autonomic nervous system.  See +corticosteroids and +adrenaline for two examples.

##### hypnosis
is a state of extreme suggestibility, likely present in all people to varying extents, which can be enhanced through certain procedures by people trained in the practice.  Roughly 1/3rd of people are readily susceptible to these hypnosis induction techniques.  It is not thought to be an altered state of +consciousness.

## I

##### implicit
refers to processes that operate in the brain below the level of +consciousness --- i.e., +subconscious processes.  The opposite of +explicit processes or +declarative knowledge.

##### independent-variable
is the +variable that is manipulated by the experimenter in an +experiment.

##### inferior
is an anatomical term that refers to the bottom portion of a brain structure, which is the opposite of +superior.  It is the same as +ventral but used in different cases.

##### inhibitory
in neuroscience, this means causing a neuron to be less excited, or less likely to fire a +spike.  More generally, can be anything that has an overall negative effect (on behavior, attitudes, etc) --- the opposite of +excitatory.

##### instrumental conditioning
is a type of conditioning involving reinforcing behaviors leading to different meaningful outcomes: positive outcomes result in an increase in the reinforced behavior, while negative outcomes have the opposite effect (Thorndike's law of effect).  Compare with +classical-conditioning which does not involve overt behavior.

##### interneuron
is a class of +neuron in the brain that are only locally connected to neighboring groups of neurons, and are most often +inhibitory, as contrasted with +pyramidal neurons that are +excitatory.  Inhibitory interneurons release +GABA that activate +postsynaptic +channels of the same name.

##### introspection
is the process of "looking within" one's own mental states and attempting to report on them.  This was one of the first methods used in psychology, by Willhelm Wundt, and the +behaviorism approach that followed represents a rejection of any attempt to deal with +subjective mental states.

##### ions
are charged atoms such as sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and potassium (K+) that power the electrical processing within a +neuron.

## J

## K 

## L

##### lateral
is an anatomical term referring to the **outer** portion of a brain structure, which is the opposite of +medial.

## M

##### medial
is an anatomical term referring to the **inner** or **middle** portion of a brain structure, which is the opposite of +lateral.  See also +ventral for a broad generalization about functions of medial areas.

##### membrane potential
is the electrical charge difference across the membrane (cell wall) of a +neuron --- this potential reflects the tug-of-war balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and when it exceeds the +threshold, an +action-potential is triggered.

##### meta-analysis
is an important statistical technique for combining results across multiple published studies, providing a much larger effective sample size, and thus much better statistical power to determine which results are reliable (+replicable) and which are not.

##### metacognitive 
is a level of self-awareness about our own internal cognitive states.  Specific examples include awareness about our level of confidence or feeling of remembering something specific.

##### methylphenidate
is a slow, long-acting drug with similar effects as +amphetamine on the +dopamine and +norepinephrine pathways, and is commonly used to treat +ADHD.  It is marketed as *Ritalin* in some countries.

##### millisecond
is one thousandth (1/1000) of a second --- the fastest your brain can process information is roughly 200 milliseconds or 1/5 of a second.

##### model
refers to an internal +representation of something else, typically in the external environment.  An internal model allows one to simulate the effects of different possible actions, for example, and is thus important for enabling more intelligent behavior.

##### motor
refers to *muscles* and physical behavior produced by actually acting through muscle pathways.

##### myelin
is an insulating sheath around the +axon, produced by special +glia cells called *oligodendrocytes*, that speeds the propagation of the electrical +action-potential to communicate with other neurons.  Myelination occurs progressively over the course of development, and is degenerated in multiple sclerosis.  

## N

##### nativism
is the idea that a significant amount of our knowledge is built into our brains from birth, presumably through the genetic code.  It is the opposite of +empiricism.

##### neoteny
is a trend toward delaying maturation and preservation of childlike features, evident in the extremely protracted period of human development compared to most other animals.  Notably, Baby Yoda (Grogu) in the Mandalorian Star Wars show has an even more protracted period of development, associated with his even greater overall intelligence.

##### neural network
refers to an artificial, simplified version of the actual networks of neurons in the brain, used in current +AI models to enable devices to understand human speech, and recognize objects in real images, among many other accomplishments.

##### neuroimaging
consists if a range of different techniques for measuring the state of the brain, including +fMRI, +EEG, and +PET.

##### neuromodulator
is a type of +neurotransmitter that has broad, widespread effects throughout the brain, serving to modulate brain functioning.  For example, +dopamine can modulate the activity and rate of learning of neurons across wide areas of the brain.  +serotonin is another neuromodulator, involved in modulating arousal and mood states throughout the brain.

##### neurotransmitter
is a chemical that is released in tiny containers (called vesicles) from the +presynaptic side of +synapses in response to the +action-potential, starting the process of neural communication from one +neuron to the next.

##### neuron
is the basic cell type in the brain that performs information processing via +compression of the roughly 10,000 input signals it receives on its +dendrites into a single +spike output on its +axon that is broadcast to many other neurons.

##### neocortex
is the evolutionarily newest part of the brain, forming the outer-most layer, which is essential for all forms of cognition.

##### norepinephrine
is a +neuromodulator released by the *locus coeruleus* ("blue area") that modulates effort and engagement.  It is known to be affected in +ADHD.

##### normalized
re-scaled (via either subtraction or division) value into a "normal" or standard range, often the 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 range.  For example, if you subtract the mean from a set of values, they are 0-normalized.  If you then divide those values by the standard deviation, then they are called "normal" values or `z` scores.  See also +standardized.

##### nucleus
refers to either an anatomically (and potentially functionally) distinguishable grouping of neurons (e.g., the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus), or to the center of an individual cell such as a +neuron, where the +DNA is, providing overall control of cellular function.

## O

##### objective
is the opposite of +subjective -- the attempt to construct an understanding of the world from a "third person" perspective, beyond the limits of one's own subjective window onto it.  Although +perception gives us the feeling of seeing the world as it is, objectively, in fact everything we see and experience is inevitably filtered through our own subjective perspective, and thus it is impossible to directly obtain an objective understanding.  Nevertheless, we can incrementally work toward developing some kind of stable, consensus of understanding among people who choose to abide by the +scientific-method.

##### OCD
is *obsessive compulsive disorder*, which is characterized by repeated thoughts typically focused on negative potential outcomes, and compulsive, repeated behaviors taken to try to avoid these negative outcomes.

##### olfaction
is the sensory modality of smell, conveyed through chemical receptors in the nose.

##### opioids
are drugs that activate the +endogenous opioid system, which is involved in regulating the neural response to pain stimuli, and also affects the +dopamine system directly and indirectly through effects on the +amygdala and +hypothalamus, among other areas.  Examples include heroin, morphine and fentanyl, which are also known as narcotics.

## P

##### paradigm
refers to an influential set of interconnected theories and data that many individual scientists believe in at a given point in time.  In psychology, examples include the paradigms of +behaviorism and +cognitivism.  Thomas Khun established the paradigm as a way of understanding the nature of scientific progress, which can get stuck in a paradigm, until enough evidence accumulates to overthrow it.

##### parasympathetic nervous system
is an +autonomic system involved in slower offline activities such as digestion and sexual reproduction ("feed and breed").

##### perception
is the higher-level product of cortical-level +compression and +contrast processing of lower-level +sensation signals, resulting in an encoding of the stable underlying state of the world that factors out incidental differences to a large extent: we see the world, not our raw sensory signals.  For example, in vision, we perceive the underlying material color, not the raw color of light hitting our eyes, and we see the expected real size of something, not how big of a region it activates on our +retina --- these are also known as color and size +constancy.

##### perspective dualism
is a form of +dualism between the +subjective and +objective perspectives.  Each person has their own unique subjective experience of what it feels like to be their own physical brain, and because each such subjective perspective arises from a different physical brain, necessarily, it is impossible for two people to ever directly share the same subjective experience.  Thus, subjective experience remains uniquely individual, and thus forever outside the realm of something that can be defined objectively, because objectivity is based on what can be shared and replicated across people.

##### PET
is *positron emission tomography*, which uses the emission of pairs of +photons generated indirectly via radioactive decay to image the brain.  It is uniquely capable of imaging specific chemicals which can be tagged with radioactive labels, but it has relatively poor spatial and temporal resolution compared to other +neuroimaging techniques.

##### photons
are the particle-like manifestation of electromagnetic radiation (light), which activate the +rods and +cones in the eyes to create visual +sensation.

##### posterior
is an anatomical term that refers to the **back** portion of a structure, which is the opposite of +anterior.  You know, the backside.

##### postsynaptic
is the receiving side of +synapses, which has +channels such as +AMPA and +GABA that are activated by +neurotransmitter release.

##### prediction
is the process of generating an expectation or guess as to what will happen next, as in +predictive-learning --- this can be a largely +implicit +subconscious process.

##### predictive learning
is an important way in which the brain learns, based on the difference between a +prediction and what actually happens, which is known to be important for producing a stable perception of the world even though our eyes are constantly moving through +saccades.

##### prefrontal
is the area at the front of +frontal cortex (i.e., the +anterior portion of the frontal lobe), which is important for higher-level +control, including integrating goals and emotional states with action plans that can achieve those goals.  It is often described as important for *executive function* --- the highest level of control.

##### presynaptic
is the sending side of +synapses, where +neurotransmitter is released at the +terminal-button.

##### program
refers to a computer program, which defines a sequence of basic operations that, when performed, accomplish some form of information processing.  For example, a simple program might sort a list in alphabetical order, while more complex programs enable you to write papers on your computer.  There are many different programming languages, but they all end up specifying a sequence of basic operations (instructions) supported by the +CPU chip in the computer, including basic arithmetic, logic, and memory reading and writing.

##### prosocial
is an attitude favoring social engagement and generally helping others --- the opposite of +antisocial

##### prosopagnosia
is the inability to recognize faces, typically present in younger children and to varying extents in different people, and occuring as a result of brain damage to specific visual areas of the brain known to be specialized for processing faces.

##### pyramidal
is the main type of +excitatory +neuron in the +neocortex, named for its pyramid-shaped body.  It releases the excitatory +neurotransmitter +glutamate at its +terminal-button that activates +AMPA +channels.

## Q

##### qualia
is the +subjective feeling of experiences --- what it *feels like* to experience something, like tasting an apple or seeing the color red.  

## R

##### raphe
is a nucleus in the +brainstem that releases +serotonin, with multiple different nuclei, each having different effects.

##### rationalism
is the philosophical approach to +epistemology that argues that much of human knowledge comes from logical reasoning.

##### receptive field
is the region over which stimulation will activate a neuron (or otherwise affect its response), e.g., in the visual pathway, this can be defined in terms of the region of an image (centered over the +fovea).

##### receptors
are cells that serve to +transduce sensory signals into neural firing signals that can then be processed by the rest of the brain.

##### recurrent
is an anatomical term describing a pathway that goes in the opposite direction of the "standard" way, and in the brain it refers to +feedback or +top-down connectivity.  It also implies the recirculation-like effects of having +bidirectional connectivity, where information can circle around the bidirectional loops, thereby "recurring" --- also known as *reentrant*.

##### relativity
is another name for the +contrast principle, where there is sensitivity only to the relative differences between things, rather than their +absolute levels.

##### replicable
refers to whether an +experiment can be repeated by following a well-specified procedure, and reliably produces the same pattern of data.  There is a *replication crisis* in a number of scientific fields including psychology, neuroscience and medicine due to a large number of published studies failing to replicate (see [@sec:ch-sci] for more discussion).

##### representation
is an internal pattern of neural activity that encodes information.  Representations are thus the basic elements of neural processing in the brain, and understanding the nature of these representations is a major ongoing focus of scientific research.

##### retina
is the light-sensitive part of our eyes, composed of +rods and +cones +receptors that +transduce +photons into electrical signals that drive further neural activity into the brain.

##### reuptake
is the process of taking +neurotransmitter back into the +presynaptic terminal for subsequent re-release.

##### rods
are the *monochromatic* (non color sensitive) +receptors in the +retina covering the entire visual field, including the peripheral area --- these are much more sensitive to low levels of light compared to +cones and thus dominate for night vision.

## S

##### saccades
are the constant movements of the eyes to focus the +fovea of the +retina onto a target point in space.  Each +fixation of the eyes lasts about 200 +milliseconds (1/5 of a second) and it takes roughly 50-100 milliseconds to move the eyes.

##### schizophrenia
is a relatively rare mental disorder characterized by *positive symptoms* such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, along with *negative symptoms* that resemble those of +depression and +anxiety.

##### scientific method
is a procedure for establishing +replicable results from [experiments](#experiment) that can build up a body of understanding that transcends the individual's +subjective experience and works toward establishing an +objective understanding of the world.  Critical elements include formulating a hypothesis, testing it by collecting data using a well-specified procedure that can be reliably replicated by others, and analyzing the data to determine if it confirmed or disconfirmed the hypothesis.

##### self-model
is an internal model of the self, potentially constructed via +predictive-learning where you learn by trying to predict your own actions in response to different situations.  Various phenomena reflect the attempt to maintain a consistent model of the self, such as +cognitive-dissonance.

##### self-organizing
means that the system organizes itself, as opposed to requiring some kind of external configuration process.  In the case of the brain, this is typically used to describe the way that learning mechanisms shape the +synapses in response to experience to produce a more capable organism, without requiring extensive external instructions or training signals.

##### sensation
refers to the raw signals produced by the primary +receptors, as contrasted with +perception which refers to the deeper, interpretive processing of sensory information.  We are not aware of raw sensation.

##### serotonin
is a +neuromodulator that modulates +arousal (wake vs. sleep) and mood, and is affected by +hallucinogenic drugs.  Compared to +dopamine which can have rapid +phasic effects, serotonin is relatively longer and slower acting.

##### socioeconomic status
(SES) is a summary of the relative wealth, education, and occupational status associated with an individual.  It has many effects on a wide range of psychological, neural and health variables, and must often be treated accordingly in a given study (e.g., by controlling for individual differences in SES).

##### spike
is a short-hand name for an +action-potential --- this is the electrical process that occurs when a +neuron gets sufficient +excitatory input to get over its firing +threshold to send a signal to other neurons.

##### standardized
refers to a measure or score that is has been +normalized into a standard range, for example IQ scores are typically standardized such that the average person has a score of 100.

##### stereotype
is a simplified mental categorization of a group of people according to a set of properties, often used instead of trying to think about distinct and complex individuals, as a form of +compression that the brain automatically does.  Some stereotypes are negative and can result in inaccurate negative impressions of individuals based on superficial characteristics that do not reflect their individual abilities and strengths.  Given the widespread cultural spreading of stereotypes, even members of negatively stereotyped groups show at least implicit, and often explicit, incorporation of these beliefs.

##### stimulants
are a broad class of drugs that stimulate activity, including +amphetamine and cocaine.

##### striatum
is the input part of the +basal-ganglia circuitry, comprised of the anatomically-defined *caudate* and *putamen*, and the *nucleus accumbens* in the +ventral part of the striatum.

##### subconscious
refers to processes operating below the level of +consciousness, as famously emphasized by Sigmund Freud.  See also +implicit.

##### subcortical
refers to all the brain areas below the level of the +neocortex, including the +thalamus, +basal-ganglia, +amygdala, +cerebellum among others.

##### subjective
the first-person perspective, available only to *you*.  The fact that only each individual can have a subjective experience raises fundamental challenges for any attempt to achieve an +objective understanding of the *mind*, which is inexorably tied to the subjective experience of *being* a brain.  Given that psychology is essentially the study of the mind, this poses fundamental challenges for the field.

##### superior
is an anatomical term that refers to the upper portion of a brain area, which is the opposite of +inferior.  It is synonymous with +dorsal, but used in different cases.

##### sympathetic nervous system
is an +autonomic system involved in mobilizing behavior for quick responses (i.e., "fight or flight"), involving the release of +adrenaline.

##### synapses
are the connections between neurons where the +action-potential arriving from the sending neuron causes the release of +neurotransmitter that then opens +channels on the receiving neuron's +dendrites, resulting in either +excitatory or +inhibitory effects depending on whether the sending neuron is an excitatory +pyramidal neuron or an inhibitory +interneuron.

## T

##### terminal button
is the end of an +axon that forms the sending, +presynaptic side of +synapses, where +neurotransmitter is released in response to an +action-potential.

##### thalamus
is a +subcortical brain area located internal to the +neocortex, with which it is extensively interconnected, providing widespread control over +arousal, and +control via its interconnectivity with the +basal-ganglia and +frontal cortex.  All sensory modalities except +olfaction route their signals through the thalamus on the way to the +neocortex.  It may also be important for +predictive-learning.

##### third variable
refers to the possibility that an observed +correlation or even +experiment result (in the case of a +confound) is due to a distinct factor other than the ones assumed in a study, which is a major problem for +correlation based studies: it is always possible that a third (or more) unmeasured +variables could be responsible for the observed outcome.

##### threshold
is the level of +excitation (technically the +membrane-potential) in a +neuron, above which it will fire an +action-potential, and below which it remains silent.

##### tolerance
is the learning-based process resulting in the need for a higher level of drug consumption to produce the same effect.  The brain learns to expect the effect of the drug, reducing the +contrast relative to this expectation.

##### top-down
refers to connections in the brain that go from higher levels back down to more sensory-specific areas in a +hierarchy.

##### transcend
is to rise above or beyond --- we say that the mind transcends the physical substrate of the brain, through +emergence.

##### transduce
means to change or transform a signal from one form to another, as +receptors do to +sensory signals.

## U

##### USs
are *unconditioned stimuli* which evoke emotionally salient internal states such as reward or pain, and serve as the critical learning signals in both +classical-conditioning and +instrumental conditioning.

## V

##### variables
are things that can be measured in scientific research studies, such as IQ, number of vocabulary words, etc.  The +independent-variable is manipulated in an +experiment, while the +dependent-variable is recorded to determine if there was an effect of the manipulation.

##### ventral
is an anatomical term that refers to the **lower**, **bottom** portion of a brain structure, which is the opposite of +dorsal.  As a very broad generalization (which is thus sometimes wrong), ventral (and +medial) areas are associated with more emotional-level processing, e.g., in the ventral striatum of the +basal-ganglia and ventral +medial +frontal cortex (and ventral +hippocampus in rats).  However, ventral areas of +posterior +neocortex are associated with recognizing objects, so that is different.

## W

##### withdrawal symptoms
are adverse feelings and physiological reactions in the body and brain associated with the withdrawal of a drug of +dependence.  In the case of heroin, these symptoms can become quite severe, as depicted in various movies.
