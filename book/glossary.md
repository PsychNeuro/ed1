### hallucinogenic

### neuron

### neocortex
the evolutionarily newest part of the brain, forming the outer-most layer, which is essential for all forms of cognition

### prediction

### predictive-learning
an important way in which the brain learns, based on the difference between a +prediction and what actually happens

### pyramidal
