  abstract: Male vollunteers performed four memory tasks either while sober or lunder
    effects of alcohol. Twenty-four hours later they were tested under the same or
    different conditions. In tasks measuiring recall and interference, learning transfer
    was better when the subject was intoxicated during both sessions than when he
    was intoxicated only during the learning session. In a task measuring recognition,
    transfer was not significantly affected by changing state. Thus, alcohol appears
    to produce "dissociated" or state-dependent effects in man, but not all forms
    of memory are equally sensitive to the phenomenon.

  abstract: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the
    conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For
    instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such
    as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum?
    And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless
    sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what
    kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the
    brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision
    and audition?

  title: Do “Brain-Training” Programs Work?
  container-title: Psychological Science in the Public Interest
  page: 103-186
  volume: '17'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In 2014, two groups of scientists published open letters on the efficacy
    of brain-training interventions, or “brain games,” for improving cognition. The
    first letter, a consensus statement from an international group of more than 70
    scientists, claimed that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded
    way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline. Several
    months later, an international group of 133 scientists and practitioners countered
    that the literature is replete with demonstrations of the benefits of brain training
    for a wide variety of cognitive and everyday activities. How could two teams of
    scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting “consensus” views
    about the effectiveness of brain training?, In part, the disagreement might result
    from different standards used when evaluating the evidence. To date, the field
    has lacked a comprehensive review of the brain-training literature, one that examines
    both the quantity and the quality of the evidence according to a well-defined
    set of best practices. This article provides such a review, focusing exclusively
    on the use of cognitive tasks or games as a means to enhance performance on other
    tasks. We specify and justify a set of best practices for such brain-training
    interventions and then use those standards to evaluate all of the published peer-reviewed
    intervention studies cited on the websites of leading brain-training companies
    listed on Cognitive Training Data (www.cognitivetrainingdata.org), the site hosting
    the open letter from brain-training proponents. These citations presumably represent
    the evidence that best supports the claims of effectiveness., Based on this examination,
    we find extensive evidence that brain-training interventions improve performance
    on the trained tasks, less evidence that such interventions improve performance
    on closely related tasks, and little evidence that training enhances performance
    on distantly related tasks or that training improves everyday cognitive performance.
    We also find that many of the published intervention studies had major shortcomings
    in design or analysis that preclude definitive conclusions about the efficacy
    of training, and that none of the cited studies conformed to all of the best practices
    we identify as essential to drawing clear conclusions about the benefits of brain
    training for everyday activities. We conclude with detailed recommendations for
    scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers that, if adopted, would lead to
    better evidence regarding the efficacy of brain-training interventions.

    People use fiction and storytelling to learn about themselves and their social world. Fans of J.K. Rowling’s popular Harry Potter book series often identify with one of the four Hogwarts school communities or “houses”\
    textemdash Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin\
    textemdash that correspond to characters’ specific traits. Fans use a feature on Rowling’s “Pottermore” website that tests their personality and sorts them into the Hogwarts house that best fits them. But what does Pottermore’s sorting quiz measure? We asked fans from online Harry Potter groups into which Hogwarts house they had been sorted on Pottermore. Fans then completed personality measures, including the Big Five traits, need to belong, need for cognition, and the Dark Triad traits\
    textemdash narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Planned contrasts found positive associations between need for cognition and placement in Ravenclaw (known for wit and learning), and between the Dark Triad traits and placement in Slytherin (known for using any means to achieve their ends). We expected\
    textemdash but did not find\
    textemdash that those in Gryffindor (known for bravery) would be higher in extraversion and openness, and that Hufflepuffs (known for loyalty) would be higher on need to belong. Our findings suggest that fiction can reflect real underlying personality dimensions.

    their children turn out welt? How much blame when they turn out badly? Judith
    Rich Harris has a message that will change parents’ lives: The "nurture assumption"
    – the belief that what makes children turn out the way they do, aside from their
    genes, is the way their parents bring them up – is nothing more than a cultural
    myth. This electrifying book explodes some of our unquestioned beliefs about children
    and parents and gives us a radically new view of childhood.Harris looks with a
    fresh eye at the real lives of real children to show that it is what they experience
    outside the home, in the company of their peers, that matters most, Parents don’t
    socialize children; children socialize children. With eloquence and humor, Judith
    Harris explains why parents have little power to determine the sort of people
    their children will become.The Nurture Assumption is an important and entertaining
    work that brings together insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, primatology,
    and evolutionary biology to offer a startling new view of who we are and how we
    got that way.'

  page: e1602750
  volume: '3'
  issue: '4'
  chapter-number: Research Article
  abstract: Current research on animal culture has focused strongly on cataloging
    the diversity of socially transmitted behaviors and on the social learning mechanisms
    that sustain their spread. Comparably less is known about the persistence of cultural
    behavior following innovation in groups of wild animals. We present observational
    data and a field experiment designed to address this question in a wild chimpanzee
    community, capitalizing on a novel tool behavior, moss-sponging, which appeared
    naturally in the community in 2011. We found that, 3 years later, moss-sponging
    was still present in the individuals that acquired the behavior shortly after
    its emergence and that it had spread further to other community members. Our field
    experiment suggests that this secondary radiation and consolidation of moss-sponging
    is the result of transmission through matrilines, in contrast to the previously
    documented, association-based spread among the initial cohort. We conclude that
    the spread of cultural behavior in wild chimpanzees follows a sequential structure
    of initial proximity-based, horizontal transmission, followed by kin-based vertical
    transmission. The acquisition of a novel tool behavior to drink water spreads
    culturally through families in wild chimpanzees. The acquisition of a novel tool
    behavior to drink water spreads culturally through families in wild chimpanzees.

  abstract: Fluctuations in attentional control can lead to failures of working memory
    (WM), in which the subject is no better than chance at reporting items from a
    recent display. In three experiments, we used a whole-report measure of visual
    WM to examine the impact of feedback on the rate of failures. In each experiment,
    subjects remembered an array of colored items across a blank delay, and then reported
    the identity of items using a whole-report procedure. In Experiment 1, we gave
    subjects simple feedback about the number of items they correctly identified at
    the end of each trial. In Experiment 2, we gave subjects additional information
    about the cumulative number of items correctly identified within each block. Finally,
    in Experiment 3, we gave subjects weighted feedback in which poor trials resulted
    in lost points and consistent successful performance received “streak” points.
    Surprisingly, simple feedback (Exp. 1) was ineffective at improving average performance
    or decreasing the rate of poor-performance trials. Simple cumulative feedback

    (2) knowledge does not transfer between tasks; (3) training by abstraction is
    of little use; and (4) instruction must be done in complex, social environments.
    In each case, we cite empirical literature to show that the claims are overstated
    and that some of the educational implications that have been taken from these
    claims are misguided.'

  publisher: Cambridge University Press
  publisher-place: New York, NY, US
  abstract: In this volume, Lave and Wenger undertake a radical and important rethinking
    and reformulation of our conception of learning. By placing emphasis on the whole
    person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually constitutive, they
    give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption that learning
    is the reception of factual knowledge or information. The authors argue that most
    accounts of learning have ignored its quintessentially social character. To make
    the crucial step away from a solely epistemological account of the person, they
    propose that learning is a process of participation in communities of practice,
    participation that is at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually
    in engagement and complexity. Learning viewed as situated activity has as its
    central defining characteristic a process that we call legitimate peripheral participation.
    By this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate
    in communities of practitioners and that the mastery of knowledge and skill requires
    newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practice of a
    community. . . . A person’s intentions to learn are engaged and the meaning of
    learning is configured through the process of becoming a full participant in a
    sociocultural practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

  volume: '35'
  abstract: Waking and sleeping states are privileged periods for distinct mnemonic
    processes. In waking behavior, rapid retrieval of previous experience aids memory-guided
    decision making. In sleep, a gradual series of reactivated associations supports
    consolidation of episodes into memory networks. Synchronized bursts of hippocampal
    place cells during events called sharp-wave ripples communicate associated neural
    patterns across distributed circuits in both waking and sleeping states. Differences
    between sleep and awake sharp-wave ripples, and in particular the accuracy of
    recapitulated experience, highlight their state-dependent roles in memory processes.

  abstract: A review of the evidence for and against the proposition that self-serving

    support for the proposition in its most general form. Some support was found for
    the contention that individuals engage in self-enhancing attributions under conditions
    of success, but only minimal evidence suggested that individuals engage in self-protective
    attributions under conditions of failure. Moreover, it was proposed that the self-enhancing
    effect may not be due to motivational distortion, but rather to the tendency of
    people to (a) expect their behavior to produce success, (b) discern a closer covariation
    between behavior and outcomes in the case of increasing success than in the case
    of constant failure, and (c) misconstrue the meaning of contingency. (60 ref)

  abstract: In organisms possessing a dispersal phase the processes of mating, competition,
    feeding, and predation are often carried out within "trait-groups," defined as
    populations enclosed in areas smaller than the boundaries of the deme. A simple
    model shows that this can lead to the selection of "altruistic" traits that favor
    the fitness of the group over that of the individual. The extent of group selection
    that occurs depends mainly on the variation in the composition of genotypes between
    trait-groups. The traditional concepts of group and individual selection are seen
    as two extremes of a continuum, with systems in nature operating over the interval
    in between.

  title: The critical role of retrieval practice in long-term retention
  container-title: Trends in Cognitive Sciences
  page: 20-27
  volume: '15'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Learning is usually thought to occur during episodes of studying, whereas
    retrieval of information on testing simply serves to assess what was learned.
    We review research that contradicts this traditional view by demonstrating that
    retrieval practice is actually a powerful mnemonic enhancer, often producing large
    gains in long-term retention relative to repeated studying. Retrieval practice
    is often effective even without feedback (i.e. giving the correct answer), but
    feedback enhances the benefits of testing. In addition, retrieval practice promotes
    the acquisition of knowledge that can be flexibly retrieved and transferred to
    different contexts. The power of retrieval practice in consolidating memories
    has important implications for both the study of memory and its application to
    educational practice.

  title-short: The Nature and Nurture of High IQ
  container-title: Psychological Science
  page: 1487-1495
  volume: '24'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: IQ predicts many measures of life success, as well as trajectories of
    brain development. Prolonged cortical thickening observed in individuals with
    high IQ might reflect an extended period of synaptogenesis and high environmental
    sensitivity or plasticity. We tested this hypothesis by examining the timing of
    changes in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on IQ as a function
    of IQ score. We found that individuals with high IQ show high environmental influence
    on IQ into adolescence (resembling younger children), whereas individuals with
    low IQ show high heritability of IQ in adolescence (resembling adults), a pattern
    consistent with an extended sensitive period for intellectual development in more-intelligent
    individuals. The pattern held across a cross-sectional sample of almost 11,000
    twin pairs and a longitudinal sample of twins, biological siblings, and adoptive
    siblings.

  abstract: Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple
    processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.
    These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition,
    visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug
    discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data
    sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change
    its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer
    from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought
    about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent
    nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.

  title: 'Temperament and arousal systems: A new synthesis of differential psychology
    and functional neurochemistry'
  title-short: Temperament and arousal systems
  container-title: Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews
  page: 382-402
  volume: '64'
  abstract: This paper critically reviews the unidimensional construct of General
    Arousal as utilised by models of temperament in differential psychology for example,
    to underlie ‘Extraversion’. Evidence suggests that specialization within monoamine
    neurotransmitter systems contrasts with the attribution of a “general arousal”
    of the Ascending Reticular Activating System. Experimental findings show specialized
    roles of noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin systems in hypothetically mediating
    three complementary forms of arousal that are similar to three functional blocks
    described in classical models of behaviour within kinesiology, clinical neuropsychology,
    psychophysiology and temperament research. In spite of functional diversity of
    monoamine receptors, we suggest that their functionality can be classified using
    three universal aspects of actions related to expansion, to selection-integration
    and to maintenance of chosen behavioural alternatives. Monoamine systems also
    differentially regulate analytic vs. routine aspects of activities at cortical
    and striatal neural levels. A convergence between main temperament models in terms
    of traits related to described functional aspects of behavioural arousal also
    supports the idea of differentiation between these aspects analysed here in a
    functional perspective.

  container-title: Psychological Science
  publisher: SAGE Publications Inc
  page: 738-748
  volume: '29'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Self-control emerges in a rich sociocultural context. Do group norms around
    self-control influence the degree to which children use it? We tested this possibility
    by assigning 3- to 5-year-old children to a group and manipulating their beliefs
    about in-group and out-group behavior on the classic marshmallow task. Across
    two experiments, children waited longer for two marshmallows when they believed
    that their in-group waited and their out-group did not, compared with children
    who believed that their in-group did not wait and their out-group did. Group behavior
    influenced children to wait more, not less, as indicated by comparisons with children
    in a control condition who were assigned to a group but received no information
    about either groups’ delay behavior (Experiment 1). Children also subsequently
    valued delaying gratification more if their in-group waited and their out-group
    did not (Experiment 2). Childhood self-control behavior and related developmental
    outcomes may be shaped by group norms around self-control, which may be an optimal
    target for interventions.

  title-short: Capture of the Late Phase of Long-Term Potentiation within and across
    the Apical and Basilar Dendritic Compartments of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 256-264
  volume: '26'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Studies in the rodent hippocampus have demonstrated that when the late
    phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is induced in a set of synapses by suprathreshold
    stimulation, L-LTP can also be expressed by other synapses receiving subthreshold
    stimulation, a phenomenon usually referred as “capture of L-LTP.” Because the
    pyramidal neurons in the mammalian hippocampus have both apical and basal dendrites,
    we have now investigated whether capture of L-LTP, previously described only within
    the apical dendritic compartment, can also take place within the basilar dendritic
    compartment and, if so, whether capture can be accomplished from one dendritic
    compartment to the other. We found that capture of L-LTP can also occur within
    the basilar dendritic compartment and that the tagging signal that enables capture
    appears to be the same in both dendritic compartments. However, capture across
    compartments, between the apical and basilar dendrites, follows different rules
    and requires a stronger triggering stimulation than capture within a compartment.
    These results suggest that the tag appears specific to a compartment either apical
    or basilar and that an additional mechanism may be required to capture across
    compartments.

  abstract: An initial attempt at formalizing a theory of social influence is presented.
    There are nine hypotheses, and a number of corollaries and derivations. The basic
    idea is that "the drive for self evaluation and the necessity for such evaluation
    being based on comparison with other persons" permits one to tie together conceptually
    both social influence processes and some kinds of competitive behavior. In this
    the relative changeability of opinions in contrast to abilities is very important.

  title: Heritability estimates of the Big Five personality traits based on common
    genetic variants
  container-title: Translational Psychiatry
  page: e604
  volume: '5'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: According to twin studies, the Big Five personality traits have substantial
    heritable components explaining 40% of the variance, but identification of associated
    genetic variants has remained elusive. Consequently, knowledge regarding the molecular
    genetic architecture of personality and to what extent it is shared across the
    different personality traits is limited. Using genomic-relatedness-matrix residual
    maximum likelihood analysis (GREML), we here estimated the heritability of the
    Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
    neuroticism and openness for experience) in a sample of 5011 European adults from
    527 469 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. We tested for the heritability
    of each personality trait, as well as for the genetic overlap between the personality
    factors. We found significant and substantial heritability estimates for neuroticism
    (15%, s.e.=0.08, P=0.04) and openness (21%, s.e.=0.08, P$<$0.01), but not for
    extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The bivariate analyses showed
    that the variance explained by common variants entirely overlapped between neuroticism
    and openness (rG=1.00, P $<$0.001), despite low phenotypic correlation (r=-0.09,
    P $<$0.001), suggesting that the remaining unique heritability may be determined
    by rare or structural variants. As far as we are aware of, this is the first study
    estimating the shared and unique heritability of all Big Five personality traits
    using the GREML approach. Findings should be considered exploratory and suggest
    that detectable heritability estimates based on common variants is shared between
    neuroticism and openness to experiences.

  abstract: Social networking sites (SNSs), such as Facebook, provide abundant social
    comparison opportunities. Given the widespread use of SNSs, the purpose of the
    present set of studies was to examine the impact of chronic and temporary exposure
    to social media-based social comparison information on self-esteem. Using a correlational
    approach, Study 1 examined whether frequent Facebook use is associated with lower
    trait self-esteem. Indeed, the results showed that participants who used Facebook
    most often had poorer trait self-esteem, and this was mediated by greater exposure
    to upward social comparisons on social media. Using an experimental approach,
    Study 2 examined the impact of temporary exposure to social media profiles on
    state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations. The results revealed that participants’
    state self-esteem and relative self-evaluations were lower when the target person’s
    profile contained upward comparison information (e.g., a high activity social
    network, healthy habits) than when the target person’s profile contained downward
    comparison information (e.g., a low activity social network, unhealthy habits).
    Results are discussed in terms of extant research and their implications for the
    role of social media in well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

  abstract: Circular representations of human nature can be traced from ancient astrology
    to Leonardo Da Vinci to the modern interpersonal circumplex (IPC) tradition. which
    began with Harry Stack Sullivan. The Kaiser Foundation Psychology Research Group
    operationalized key concepts of Sullivan’s and Timothy Leary (1957) provided extensions
    of Sullivanian theory that formed the conceptual basis for contemporary circumplex
    models The current generation of circumplex investigators is exceptionally well
    represented by the contributors to this special series. The IPC can serve as an
    integrative cognitive framework for making sense of diverse realms that are well
    outside its original focus of convenience. The visual and psychological appeal
    of this powerful model is briefly illustrated.

  title: 'The cognitive neuroscience of sleep: Neuronal systems, consciousness and
    learning'
  title-short: The cognitive neuroscience of sleep
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: 679-693
  volume: '3'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: 'Recent studies of sleep that bring closer the development of a cognitive
    neuroscience of conscious states are reviewed to reveal a unique integration of
    mechanistic and functional concepts. The electrophysiology of non-rapid eye movement
    (NREM) sleep has been detailed to reveal the effects of brainstem reticular and
    neuromodulatory deactivation of the thalamocortical system. But instead of viewing
    these changes simply as inactivation, it has been suggested that the slow waves
    and spindles of NREM might reflect a differential mode of information processing
    by the brain in sleep. In particular, these findings are compatible with a two-stage
    hypothesis of sleep enhancement of plasticity a model that is also supported by
    studies of human cognitive enhancement in sleep. The transformational role of
    two methodological innovations is emphasized. Home-based studies of sleep allow
    investigators to obtain vast amounts of data about the kind of consciousness that
    is associated with active waking, quiet waking, sleep onset, NREM and REM sleep.
    At the same time, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is used to reveal
    the relative blood flow in different regions of the human brain in waking, NREM
    and REM sleep. The data from these two sources are complementary and informative.
    For example, in REM sleep (compared with waking) there is more blood flow directed
    towards the brain stem, the limbic forebrain and the parietal operculum; these
    findings map onto the marked increase in hallucinatory experience during REM.
    By contrast, the low levels of thinking during REM map onto the decrease in dorsolateral
    prefrontal cortical blood flow in that state. The relevance of these findings
    to the brain-based activationsynthesis theory of dreaming is stressed by a systematic
    review of the differential increases in activation of forebrain structures revealed
    by PET imaging in: ascending arousal systems; thalamocortical and thalamic subcortical
    structures; limbic and paralimbic structures; motor initiation and control areas;
    visual association cortex; and the inferior parietal lobe. Plasticity is now thought
    to be a major functional process that is generated by sleep. This idea is supported
    by recent developmental and human memory studies. The human cognitive studies
    reveal enhancement of learning by both NREM and REM sleep, indicating a two-stage
    process. Such a model shares assumptions and structures with Buzsáki’s electrophysiological
    model of a hippocampal-neocortical dialogue. Buzsáki posits a transfer of data
    from neocortex to hippocampus in active waking, and consolidation of information
    within the hippocampus along with its transfer back to the neocortex for longer-term
    storage during quiet waking and NREM. Recent experimental and theoretical work
    further indicates that intracortical processing occurs during REM, at which time
    new associative connections might be formed within the neocortex.'

  title: The organization of networks within the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex
    of rats, monkeys and humans.
  container-title: Cerebral Cortex
  page: 206-219
  volume: '10'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: |-
    This paper reviews architectonic subdivisions and connections of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) in rats, monkeys and humans. Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of ‘medial’ and ‘orbital’ networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory\
    textendash visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to be critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.

  title-short: Disfluent difficulties are not desirable difficulties
  container-title: Memory
  publisher: Routledge
  page: 850-857
  volume: '28'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Scientists working at the intersection of cognitive psychology and education
    have developed theoretically-grounded methods to help people learn. One important
    yet counterintuitive finding is that making information harder to learn that is,
    creating desirable difficulties benefits learners. Some studies suggest that simply
    presenting information in a difficult-to-read font could serve as a desirable
    difficulty and therefore promote learning. To address this possibility, we examined
    the extent to which Sans Forgetica, a newly developed font, improves memory performance
    as the creators of the font claim. Across four experiments, we set out to replicate
    unpublished findings by the font’s creators. Subjects read information in Sans
    Forgetica or Arial, and rated how difficult the information was to read (Experiment
    1) or attempted to recall the information (Experiments 2). Although subjects rated
    Sans Forgetica as being more difficult to read than Arial, Sans Forgetica led
    to equivalent memory performance, and sometimes even impaired it. These findings
    suggest that although Sans Forgetica promotes a feeling of disfluency, it does
    not create a desirable difficulty or benefit memory.

    in particular, the spotlight effect, or people s tendency to overestimate the
    extent to which their behavior and appearance are noticed and evaluated by others,
    and the illusion of transparency, or people s tendency to overestimate the extent
    to which their internal states leak out and are detectable by others.

  title: Functional brain networks related to individual differences in human intelligence
    at rest
  container-title: Scientific Reports
  page: '32328'
  volume: '6'
  abstract: Intelligence is a fundamental ability that sets humans apart from other
    animal species. Despite its importance in defining human behaviour, the neural
    networks responsible for intelligence are not well understood. The dominant view
    from neuroimaging work suggests that intelligent performance on a range of tasks
    is underpinned by segregated interactions in a fronto-parietal network of brain
    regions. Here we asked whether fronto-parietal interactions associated with intelligence
    are ubiquitous, or emerge from more widespread associations in a task-free context.
    First we undertook an exploratory mapping of the existing literature on functional
    connectivity associated with intelligence. Next, to empirically test hypotheses
    derived from the exploratory mapping, we performed network analyses in a cohort
    of 317 unrelated participants from the Human Connectome Project. Our results revealed
    a novel contribution of across-network interactions between default-mode and fronto-parietal
    networks to individual differences in intelligence at rest. Specifically, we found
    that greater connectivity in the resting state was associated with higher intelligence
    scores. Our findings highlight the need to broaden the dominant fronto-parietal
    conceptualisation of intelligence to encompass more complex and context-specific
    network dynamics.

  volume: '21'

  abstract: Describes 3 experiments with a total of 92 3-5 yr. olds. Exp. I compared
    the effects of external and cognitive distraction from reward objects on the length
    of time which Ss waited for a preferred delayed reward before forfeiting it for
    a less preferred immediate one. In accord with predictions from an extension of
    frustrative nonreward theory, Ss waited much longer for a preferred reward when
    they were distracted from the rewards. Exp. II demonstrated that only certain
    cognitive events (thinking "fun things") served as effective ideational distractors.
    Thinking "sad thoughts" produced short delay times, as did thinking about the
    rewards themselves. In Exp. III the delayed rewards were not physically available
    for direct attention during the delay period, and Ss’ cognitive attention was
    manipulated by prior instructions. While Ss waited, cognitions about the rewards
    significantly reduced, rather than enhanced, the length of their delay of gratification.
    Overall, attentional and cognitive mechanisms which enhanced the salience of rewards
    shortened the length of voluntary delay, while distractions from the rewards,
    overtly or cognitively, facilitated delay. Results permit a reinterpretation of
    basic mechanisms in voluntary delay of gratification and self-control. (16 ref.)

    The actor-observer hypothesis (E. E. Jones\
    & R. E. Nisbett, 1971) states that people tend to explain their own behavior with situation causes and other people’s behavior with person causes. Widely known in psychology, this asymmetry has been described as robust, firmly established, and pervasive. However, a meta-analysis on 173 published studies revealed average effect sizes from d = -0.016 to d = 0.095. A moderator analysis showed that the asymmetry held only when the actor was portrayed as highly idiosyncratic, when hypothetical events were explained, when actor and observer were intimates, or when free-response explanations were coded. In addition, the asymmetry held for negative events, but a reverse asymmetry held for positive events. This valence effect may indicate a self-serving pattern in attribution, but across valence, no actor-observer asymmetry exists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

  title: Prevalence of Healthy Sleep Duration among Adults–United States, 2014
  container-title: MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report
  page: 137-141
  volume: '65'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: To promote optimal health and well-being, adults aged 18-60 years are
    recommended to sleep at least 7 hours each night (1). Sleeping $<$7 hours per
    night is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,
    coronary heart disease, stroke, frequent mental distress, and all-cause mortality
    (2-4). Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance, which can increase the
    likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation accidents, industrial accidents,
    medical errors, and loss of work productivity that could affect the wider community
    (5). CDC analyzed data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
    (BRFSS) to determine the prevalence of a healthy sleep duration ($\geq$ 7 hours)
    among 444,306 adult respondents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
    A total of 65.2% of respondents reported a healthy sleep duration; the age-adjusted
    prevalence of healthy sleep was lower among non-Hispanic blacks, American Indians/Alaska
    Natives, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and multiracial respondents, compared
    with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Asians. State-based estimates of healthy
    sleep duration prevalence ranged from 56.1% in Hawaii to 71.6% in South Dakota.
    Geographic clustering of the lowest prevalence of healthy sleep duration was observed
    in the southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian Mountains,
    and the highest prevalence was observed in the Great Plains states. More than
    one third of U.S. respondents reported typically sleeping $<$7 hours in a 24-hour
    period, suggesting an ongoing need for public awareness and public education about
    sleep health; worksite shift policies that ensure healthy sleep duration for shift
    workers, particularly medical professionals, emergency response personnel, and
    transportation industry personnel; and opportunities for health care providers
    to discuss the importance of healthy sleep duration with patients and address
    reasons for poor sleep health.

  title: Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge
  container-title: Nature
  page: 354-359
  volume: '550'
  issue: '7676'
  abstract: |-
    A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\
    textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.

  abstract: One simple marshmallow test in preschool children predicts an array of
    important life outcomes, according to multiple studies spanning several decades.
    However, a recent conceptual replication casts doubt on these famous findings.
    We conducted an independent, preregistered secondary analysis to test whether
    previously observed longitudinal associations between preschool delay of gratification
    and adolescent outcomes would be conceptually replicated. Associations were significant
    for three of the five outcomes we tested using the analytic approach employed
    in the original studies of the marshmallow test. Relationships between delay of
    gratification and problem behavior held in bivariate, multivariate, and multilevel
    models; in contrast, no significant relationships between delay and problem behavior
    were found in the other recent replication, even though both studies used the
    same data set. These relationships were better explained by social support than
    by self-control, suggesting that the marshmallow test is predictive because it
    reflects aspects of a child’s early environment that are important over the long
    term. This novel interpretation of the classic findings points to new directions
    for intervention.

  page: 880-896
  volume: '93'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Factor analyses of 75 facet scales from 2 major Big Five inventories,
    in the Eugene-Springfield community sample (N=481), produced a 2-factor solution
    for the 15 facets in each domain. These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct
    (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate
    level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized
    these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the
    International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations
    allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five
    Aspect Scales \[BFAS\]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally,
    the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from
    10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance
    among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002).
    The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big
    Five may have distinct biological substrates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

  abstract: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that personality pathology
    is, at its core, fundamentally interpersonal. The authors review the proposed
    DSM-5 Section 3 redefinition of personality pathology involving self and interpersonal
    dysfunction, which they regard as a substantial improvement over the DSM-IV (and
    Section 2) definition. They note similarities between the proposed scheme and
    contemporary interpersonal theory and interpret the Section 3 definition using
    the underlying assumptions and evidence base of the interpersonal paradigm in
    clinical psychology. The authors describe how grounding the proposed Section 3
    definition in interpersonal theory, and in particular a focus on the “interpersonal
    situation,” adds to its theoretical texture, empirical support, and clinical utility.
    They provide a clinical example that demonstrates the ability of contemporary
    interpersonal theory to augment the definition of personality pathology. The authors
    conclude with directions for further research that could clarify the core of personality
    pathology, and how interpersonal theory can inform research aimed at enhancing
    the Section 3 proposal and ultimately justify its migration to Section 2.

  abstract: The behavioral activation (BA) approach to treating depression has received
    very strong empirical support in the past few years, with results as good or better
    than cognitive therapy and antidepressant medications, even for the most severe
    cases of depression. Seemingly counterintuitive at first blush, this treatment
    does not focus on the notion of "just do it" but takes a comprehensive look at
    contingent relationships in the patient’s life across the full range of behavior,
    cognition, and affect that may be maintaining the depression. As such, this very
    idiographic approach does not prescribe a set number of sessions to accomplish
    certain goals but is very adaptable to the individual with depression. In the
    detailed and very human description of the treatment of "Mark," readers will also
    note a very up-to-date focus on the role of rumination in depression (or worry
    in anxiety) as a fundamentally avoidant technique. The illustration of creative
    therapeutic strategies for activating patients, and the very adaptable and flexible
    nature of BA will be of interest to all therapists treating depression, since
    it may be one of the easiest to learn and most disseminable of evidence-based
    psychological treatments for depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA,

  page: 429-444
  volume: '55'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Allport (1954) recognized that attachment to one’s ingroups does not necessarily
    require hostility toward outgroups. Yet the prevailing approach to the study of
    ethnocentrism, ingroup bias, and prejudice presumes that ingroup love and outgroup
    hate are reciprocally related. Findings from both cross-cultural research and
    laboratory experiments support the alternative view that ingroup identification
    is independent of negative attitudes toward outgroups and that much ingroup bias
    and intergroup discrimination is motivated by preferential treatment of ingroup
    members rather than direct hostility toward outgroup members. Thus to understand
    the roots of prejudice and discrimination requires first of all a better understanding
    of the functions that ingroup formation and identification serve for human beings.
    This article reviews research and theory on the motivations for maintenance of
    ingroup boundaries and the implications of ingroup boundary protection for intergroup
    relations, conflict, and conflict prevention.

  volume: '66'

  abstract: |-
    Acculturation and ethnic identity may be associated with Latino/as’ educational outcomes and be relevant to their lower levels of academic achievement. This article explores how these relationships might be mediated by considering several empirically supported and theory-based social psychological processes\
    textemdash the self-fulfilling prophecy, stigma consciousness, and stereotype threat. These processes suggest specific mediational mechanisms that remain largely unexamined, thereby offering novel directions for research and the potential to enrich understanding of the relationship between Latino/a ethnicity and academic performance. Consideration of these mediational mechanisms suggests that some groups within the Latino/a population face even greater challenges with regard to educational achievement. Accordingly, the particular difficulties encountered by Latinas and the children of families of migrant workers and new and undocumented immigrants are discussed. In addition, the potential relevance of education policies to the operation of the reviewed processes is explored.

  container-title: Nature Genetics
  page: 1107-1112
  volume: '49'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Intelligence is associated with important economic and health-related
    life outcomes1. Despite intelligence having substantial heritability2 (0.54) and
    a confirmed polygenic nature, initial genetic studies were mostly underpowered3,4,5.
    Here we report a meta-analysis for intelligence of 78,308 individuals. We identify
    336 associated SNPs (METAL P $<$ 5 10-8) in 18 genomic loci, of which 15 are new.
    Around half of the SNPs are located inside a gene, implicating 22 genes, of which
    11 are new findings. Gene-based analyses identified an additional 30 genes (MAGMA
    P $<$ 2.73 10-6), of which all but one had not been implicated previously. We
    show that the identified genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue, and
    pathway analysis indicates the involvement of genes regulating cell development
    (MAGMA competitive P = 3.5 10-6). Despite the well-known difference in twin-based
    heritability2 for intelligence in childhood (0.45) and adulthood (0.80), we show
    substantial genetic correlation (rg = 0.89, LD score regression P = 5.4 10-29).
    These findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of intelligence.

    continues'
  title-short: Pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation
  container-title: The Behavior Analyst
  page: 1-44
  volume: '24'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: A major concern in psychology and education is that rewards decrease intrinsic
    motivation to perform activities. Over the past 30 years, more than 100 experimental
    studies have been conducted on this topic. In 1994, Cameron and Pierce conducted
    a meta-analysis of this literature and concluded that negative effects of reward
    were limited and could be easily prevented in applied settings. A more recent
    meta-analysis of the literature by Deci, Koestner, and Ryan (1999) shows pervasive
    negative effects of reward. The purpose of the present article is to resolve differences
    in previous meta-analytic findings and to provide a meta-analysis of rewards and
    intrinsic motivation that permits tests of competing theoretical explanations.
    Our results suggest that in general, rewards are not harmful to motivation to
    perform a task. Rewards given for low-interest tasks enhance free-choice intrinsic
    motivation. On high-interest tasks, verbal rewards produce positive effects on
    free-choice motivation and self-reported task interest. Negative effects are found
    on high-interest tasks when the rewards are tangible, expected (offered beforehand),
    and loosely tied to level of performance. When rewards are linked to level of
    performance, measures of intrinsic motivation increase or do not differ from a
    nonrewarded control group. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that reward
    contingencies do not have pervasive negative effects on intrinsic motivation.
    Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are addressed.

  abstract: An overview of existing data on imitation in infancy suggests that changes
    in the direction of imitation research are underway. The widely accepted view
    that newborn infants imitate lacks supporting evidence. Instead, existing data
    suggest that infants do not imitate others until their second year, and that imitation
    of different kinds of behaviour emerges at different ages. The evidence is consistent
    with a dynamic systems account in which the ability to imitate is not an inherited,
    specialized module, but is instead the emergent product of a system of social,
    cognitive and motor components, each with its own developmental history.

  abstract: 'We propose a minimalist stochastic model of multilevel (or group) selection.
    A population is subdivided into groups. Individuals interact with other members
    of the group in an evolutionary game that determines their fitness. Individuals
    reproduce, and offspring are added to the same group. If a group reaches a certain
    size, it can split into two. Faster reproducing individuals lead to larger groups
    that split more often. In our model, higher-level selection emerges as a byproduct
    of individual reproduction and population structure. We derive a fundamental condition
    for the evolution of cooperation by group selection: if b/c $>$ 1 + n/m, then
    group selection favors cooperation. The parameters b and c denote the benefit
    and cost of the altruistic act, whereas n and m denote the maximum group size
    and the number of groups. The model can be extended to more than two levels of
    selection and to include migration.'

  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  page: 4-27
  volume: '102'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Social behavior is ordinarily treated as being under conscious (if not
    always thoughtful) control. However, considerable evidence now supports the view
    that social behavior often operates in an implicit or unconscious fashion. The
    identifying feature of implicit cognition is that past experience influences judgment
    in a fashion not introspectively known by the actor. The present conclusion–that
    attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes have important implicit modes of operation–extends
    both the construct validity and predictive usefulness of these major theoretical
    constructs of social psychology. Methodologically, this review calls for increased
    use of indirect measures–which are imperative in studies of implicit cognition.
    The theorized ordinariness of implicit stereotyping is consistent with recent
    findings of discrimination by people who explicitly disavow prejudice. The finding
    that implicit cognitive effects are often reduced by focusing judges’ attention
    on their judgment task provides a basis for evaluating applications (such as affirmative
    action) aimed at reducing such unintended discrimination. (PsycINFO Database Record

  container-title: Journal of Research in Personality
  page: 179-201
  volume: '38'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Cross-observer agreement on personality trait ratings has been interpreted
    as particularly powerful evidence of the veridicality of personality traits, but
    cross-cultural studies of consensual validity are relatively rare. In this article
    we review the available literature on cross-observer agreement on traits of the
    Five-Factor Model, and provide new data from Russia and the Czech Republic. Russian
    and Czech versions of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory showed adequate internal
    consistency and replicated the American factor structure and gender differences.
    Cross-observer correlations showed moderate to high agreement, especially for
    Extraversion. Despite cultural differences in individualism/collectivism that
    affect many psychological processes, these data suggest that personality traits
    exist and function in much the same way in these cultures.

  title: A systems-neuroscience model of phasic dopamine
  abstract: We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of the phasic
    dopamine signal- ing system that can account for a wider range of phenomena than
    simpler reward prediction error (RPE) accounts. The central feature of this PVLV
    framework is the distinction between a Primary Value (PV) system for anticipating
    the onset of primary rewards (USs), and a Learned Value (LV) system for learning
    about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system corresponds to
    the amygdala and its ability to drive phasic dopamine bursting in midbrain dopamine
    areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum (principally the nucleus
    accumbens, NAc), which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs
    (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the
    lateral habenula, LHb). We show how our model can account for a range of data
    supporting the separability of these systems, including the non-zero- sum nature
    of CS and US firing, and individual differences in CS-based learning (sign-tracking)
    vs. US-based learning (goal-tracking). A critical feature of both systems is the
    use of opponent- processing pathways that represent the competing strengths of
    the evidence in favor and opposed to specific USs, and we show how these pathways
    can explain a range of important data dissociat- ing the processes involved in
    acquisition vs. extinction conditioning, including rapid reaquisition, reinstatement,
    and renewal. Furthermore, this opponent structure is critical for being able to
    ac- count for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the surprisingly
    closely-related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional
    separable pathways rep- resenting aversive USs, which largely mirror those for
    appetitive USs, also have some important differences from the positive valence
    case, which allow the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive
    conditioning. Overall, the ability to account for all of these phenomena strongly
    constrains the form of the model, which thus provides a well-validated framework
    for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.

    intelligence. I now argue that working memory tasks reflect primarily the maintenance
    of information, whereas fluid intelligence tests reflect primarily the ability
    to disengage from recently attended and no longer useful information. I also point
    out some conclusions in the 2002 article that now appear to be wrong.

  publisher: Taylor & Francis
  abstract: 'This book provides an up-to-date review of commonly undertaken methodological
    and statistical practices that are sustained, in part, upon sound rationale and
    justification and, in part, upon unfounded lore. Some examples of these "methodological
    urban legends", as we refer to them in this book, are characterized by manuscript
    critiques such as: (a) "your self-report measures suffer from common method bias";
    (b) "your item-to-subject ratios are too low"; (c) "you canâe(tm)t generalize
    these findings to the real world"; or (d) "your effect sizes are too low".Historically,
    there is a kernel of truth to most of these legends, but in many cases that truth
    has been long forgotten, ignored or embellished beyond recognition. This book
    examines several such legends. Each chapter is organized to address: (a) what
    the legend is that "we (almost) all know to be true"; (b) what the "kernel of
    truth" is to each legend; (c) what the myths are that have developed around this
    kernel of truth; and (d) what the state of the practice should be. This book meets
    an important need for the accumulation and integration of these methodological
    and statistical practices.'

  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: 942-951
  volume: '7'
  issue: '12'
  abstract: 'Mirror neurons are cells located in the premotor and posterior parietal
    cortex of the macaque brain. These cells fire when the monkey performs a goal-directed
    action and when it sees somebody else performing the same action.Two areas of
    the macaque brain contain mirror neurons, area F5 in the inferior frontal cortex
    and area PF/PFG in the inferior parietal cortex. These areas are anatomically
    interconnected and embedded in parallel frontoparietal networks for sensorimotor
    integration.Mirror neurons in monkeys also respond to the sound of actions, and
    code the intention associated with the observed action. This suggests that the
    mirror neuron system (MNS) is a key neural system for social cognition.In humans,
    mirror neuron areas are located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus and adjacent
    ventral premotor cortex, and in the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule.
    The human MNS is causally related to imitation, a crucial factor for social interactions
    and learning.The human MNS is also concerned with other aspects of social cognition,
    from understanding the intentions of other people to empathizing with them. Through
    interactions with the limbic system, the human MNS allows the understanding of
    emotional states of other people.Evidence of MNS abnormalities in autism spectrum
    disorder (ASD) is provided by structural MRI, magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography,
    transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional MRI (fMRI). fMRI data show that
    children with ASD have reduced MNS activity during social mirroring and that MNS
    activity correlates with the severity of disease: the higher the impairment, the
    lower the MNS activity in ASD.'

  title: Integrated Intelligence from Distributed Brain Activity
  container-title: Trends in Cognitive Sciences
  page: 838-852
  volume: '24'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: How does organized cognition arise from distributed brain activity? Recent
    analyses of fluid intelligence suggest a core process of cognitive focus and integration,
    organizing the components of a cognitive operation into the required computational
    structure. A cortical ‘multiple-demand’ (MD) system is closely linked to fluid
    intelligence, and recent imaging data define nine specific MD patches distributed
    across frontal, parietal, and occipitotemporal cortex. Wide cortical distribution,
    relative functional specialization, and strong connectivity suggest a basis for
    cognitive integration, matching electrophysiological evidence for binding of cognitive
    operations to their contents. Though still only in broad outline, these data suggest
    how distributed brain activity can build complex, organized cognition.

  page: 9673-9678
  volume: '102'
  issue: '27'
  abstract: During performance of attention-demanding cognitive tasks, certain regions
    of the brain routinely increase activity, whereas others routinely decrease activity.
    In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy
    is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of
    spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal.
    We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the
    basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations
    between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related
    activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations.
    This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks
    in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which
    to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses
    and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization
    of the brain.

  title: Heritability of Word Recognition in Middle-Aged Men Varies as a Function
    of Parental Education
  container-title: Behavior Genetics
  page: 417-433
  volume: '35'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Although it is of lifelong importance, reading ability is studied primarily
    in children and adolescents. We examined variation in word recognition in 347
    middle-aged male twin pairs. Overall heritability (a2) was 0.45, and shared environmental
    influences (c2) were 0.28. However, parental education moderated heritability
    such that a2 was 0.21 at the lowest parental education level and 0.69 at the highest
    level; c2 was 0.52 and 0.00, respectively. This constitutes a parental education
    environment interaction. The higher heritability was due to a decrease in the
    magnitude of shared environmental factors, rather than an increase in the magnitude
    of genetic factors. Other cognitive studies have reported gene environment interactions,
    but patterns may differ as a function of age or specific cognitive abilities.
    Our results suggest that shared environmental factors in families with low parental
    education have long-lasting effects on word recognition ability, well beyond any
    critical period for developing reading proficiency.

  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 23-81
  volume: '262'
  issue: '841'
  abstract: It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is
    its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
    general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models
    for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex.
    The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation,
    which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about
    200 out of a population of 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ cells. It is shown
    that if about 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ simple representations are
    stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt
    event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is
    made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions
    are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive
    theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given
    of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum,
    the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
    number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification
    of typical archicortical cells is proposed.

  volume: '103'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The developmental theory of Jean Piaget has been criticized on the grounds
    that it is conceptually limited, empirically false, or philosophically and epistemologically
    untenable. This study attempts to rebut these criticisms by showing that most
    of them (a) derive from widespread misinterpretations of the work of Piaget; (b)
    fail to appreciate the 2 central issues of his thinkinghow new forms of thinking
    emerge during ontogenesis and how they become psychologically necessary; (c) incorrectly
    assume that many controversies concerning his theory can be settled empirically
    or methodologically before they are clarified conceptually; (d) ignore various
    modifications of Piagetian theory, particularly those advanced after 1970; and
    (e) forget the dialectical, constructivist, and developmental nature of Piaget’s
    unique approach to human development. Although the authors do not claim there
    is a "true" Piaget to be discovered, or that the problems with his theory vanish
    when it is better understood, they do claim that important aspects of Piaget’s
    work have not been assimilated by developmental psychologists. (PsycINFO Database

  title: Vagus Nerve as Modulator of the BrainGut Axis in Psychiatric and Inflammatory
    Disorders
  container-title: Frontiers in Psychiatry
  publisher: Frontiers
  volume: '9'
  abstract: The vagus nerve represents the main component of the parasympathetic nervous
    system, which oversees a vast array of crucial bodily functions including control
    of mood, immune response, digestion and heart rate. It establishes one of the
    connections between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract and sends information
    about the state of the inner organs to the brain via afferent fibers. In this
    review article, we discuss various functions of the vagus nerve which make it
    an attractive target in treating psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. There
    is preliminary evidence that vagus nerve stimulation is a promising add-on treatment
    for treatment-refractory depression, PTSD and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatments
    that target the vagus nerve increase the vagal tone and inhibit cytokine production.
    Both are important mechanism of resiliency. The stimulation of vagal afferent
    fibers in the gut influences monoaminergic brain systems in the brain stem that
    play crucial roles in major psychiatric conditions such as mood and anxiety disorders.
    In line, there is preliminary evidence for gut bacteria to have beneficial effect
    on mood and anxiety, partly by affecting the activity of the vagus nerve. Since
    the vagal tone is correlated with capacity to regulate stress responses and can
    be influenced by breathing, its increase through meditation and yoga likely contribute
    to resilience and the mitigation of mood and anxiety symptoms.

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs\

    textemdash which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.

  publisher: Psychology Press
  abstract: After many "out-of-print" years, this volume has been reissued in response
    to an increasing demand for copies. This reflects that the fundamental questions
    that motivated this book thirty years ago are still being asked. But more important,
    the answers – or at least their outlines – now seem to be in sight. In 1968, this
    book stood as an expression of a paradigm crisis in its critique of the state
    of personality psychology. The last three decades have been filled with controversy
    and debate about the dilemmas raised here, and then with renewal and fresh discoveries.
    It therefore seems especially timely to revisit the pages which posed the challenges.
    Mischel outlined the need to encompass the situation in the study of personality,
    but with a focus on the acquired meaning of stimuli and on the situation as perceived,
    viewing the individual as a cognitive-affective being who construes, interprets,
    and transforms the stimulus in a dynamic reciprocal interaction with the social
    world. He focused on the idiographic analysis of personality that had originally
    motivated the field, and the complexity, discriminative facility, and uniqueness
    of the individual, and sought to connect the expressions of personality to the
    individual’s behavior – that is, to what people do and not just what they say.
    Even the intrinsically contextualized "if...then..." expressions of the personality
    system – its essential behavioral signatures – were foreshadowed in this book
    that fired the opening salvo in a search for "a truly dynamic personality psychology."

    Objective Twin studies of behavior problems in childhood point to substantial genetic influence. It is now possible to estimate genetic influence using DNA alone in samples of unrelated individuals, not relying on family-based designs such as twins. A linear mixed model, which incorporates DNA microarray data, has confirmed twin results by showing substantial genetic influence for diverse traits in adults. Here we present direct comparisons between twin and DNA heritability estimates for childhood behavior problems as rated by parents, teachers, and children themselves. Method Behavior problem data from 2,500 UK-representative 12-year-old twin pairs were used in twin analyses; DNA analyses were based on 1 member of the twin pair with genotype data for 1.7 million DNA markers. Diverse behavior problems were assessed, including autistic, depressive, and hyperactive symptoms. Genetic influence from DNA was estimated using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and the twin estimates of heritability were based on standard twin model fitting. Results Behavior problems in childhood\
    textemdash whether rated by parents, teachers, or children themselves\
    textemdash show no significant genetic influence using GCTA, even though twin study estimates of heritability are substantial in the same sample, and even though both GCTA and twin study estimates of genetic influence are substantial for cognitive and anthropometric traits. Conclusions We suggest that this new type of “missing heritability,” that is, the gap between GCTA and twin study estimates for behavior problems in childhood, is due to nonadditive genetic influence, which will make it more difficult to identify genes responsible for heritability.

  abstract: |-
    Since its release in 1949, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced millions of readers by combining the insights of modern psychology with Joseph Campbell’s revolutionary understanding of comparative mythology. In these pages, Campbell outlines the Hero’s Journey, a universal motif of adventure and transformation that runs through virtually all of the world’s mythic traditions. He also explores the Cosmogonic Cycle, the mythic pattern of world creation and destruction. As part of the Joseph Campbell Foundation’s Collected Works of Joseph Campbell, this third edition features expanded illustrations, a comprehensive bibliography, and more accessible sidebars. As relevant today as when it was first published, The Hero with a Thousand Faces continues to find new audiences in fields ranging from religion and anthropology to literature and film studies. The book has also profoundly influenced creative artists\
    textemdash including authors, songwriters, game designers, and filmmakers\
    textemdash and continues to inspire all those interested in the inherent human need to tell stories.

  abstract: We describe in detail normal personality traits in persons with psychiatrist-ascertained
    anxiety and depressive disorders in a general population sample. We investigated
    Revised NEO Personality Inventory traits in 731 community subjects examined by
    psychiatrists with the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. All
    of the lifetime disorders of interest (simple phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia,
    panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder,
    major depressive disorder (MDD), and dysthymia) were associated with high neuroticism.
    Social phobia, agoraphobia, and dysthymia were associated with low extraversion,
    and OCD was associated with high openness to experience. In addition, lower-order
    facets of extraversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness
    (C) were associated with certain disorders (specifically, low assertiveness (E)
    and high openness to feelings (O) with MDD, low trust (A) with social phobia and
    agoraphobia, low self-discipline (C) with several of the disorders, and low competence
    and achievement striving (C) with social phobia). Neuroticism in particular was
    related to acuity of disorder. Longitudinal study is necessary to differentiate
    state versus pathoplastic effects.

  title: Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity
    (readiness-potential). The unconscious initiation of a freely voluntary act
  container-title: 'Brain: A Journal of Neurology'
  page: 623-642
  volume: 106 (Pt 3)
  abstract: The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes
    a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the
    reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of ’wanting’ or
    intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least
    several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act.
    This relationship held even for those series (with ’type II’ RPs) in which subjects
    reported that all of the 40 self-initiated movements in the series appeared ’spontaneously’
    and capriciously. Data were obtained in at least 6 different experimental sessions
    with each of 5 subjects. In series with type II RPs, onset of the main negative
    shift in each RP preceded the corresponding mean W value by an average of about
    350 ms, and by a minimum of about 150 ms. In series with type I RPs, in which
    an experience of preplanning occurred in some of the 40 self-initiated acts, onset
    of RP preceded W by an average of about 800 ms (or by 500 ms, taking onset of
    RP at 90 per cent of its area). Reports of W time depended upon the subject’s
    recall of the spatial ’clock-position’ of a revolving spot at the time of his
    initial awareness of wanting or intending to move. Two different modes of recall
    produced similar values. Subjects distinguished awareness of wanting to move (W)
    from awareness of actually moving (M). W times were consistently and substantially
    negative to, in advance of, mean times reported for M and also those for S, the
    sensation elicited by a task-related skin stimulus delivered at irregular times
    that were unknown to the subject. It is concluded that cerebral initiation of
    a spontaneous, freely voluntary act can begin unconsciously, that is, before there
    is any (at least recallable) subjective awareness that a ’decision’ to act has
    already been initiated cerebrally. This introduces certain constraints on the
    potentiality for conscious initiation and control of voluntary acts.

  container-title: The Behavioral and Brain Sciences
  page: 137-150; discussion 150-193
  volume: '33'
  issue: 2-3
  abstract: 'The pivotal problem of comorbidity research lies in the psychometric
    foundation it rests on, that is, latent variable theory, in which a mental disorder
    is viewed as a latent variable that causes a constellation of symptoms. From this
    perspective, comorbidity is a (bi)directional relationship between multiple latent
    variables. We argue that such a latent variable perspective encounters serious
    problems in the study of comorbidity, and offer a radically different conceptualization
    in terms of a network approach, where comorbidity is hypothesized to arise from
    direct relations between symptoms of multiple disorders. We propose a method to
    visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression
    and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses
    about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries,
    that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to
    comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways
    generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms
    of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and
    boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.'

  title: The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory
  publisher: Oxford University Press
  publisher-place: Oxford, New York
  edition: Second Edition
  abstract: To understand how the brain learns and remembers requires an integration
    of psychological concepts and behavioral methods with mechanisms of synaptic plasticity
    and systems neuroscience. The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, Second Edition,
    provides a synthesis of this interdisciplinary field. Each chapter makes the key
    concepts transparent and accessible to a reader with minimal background in either
    neurobiology or psychology and is extensively illustrated with full-color photographs
    and figures depicting important concepts and experimental data. Like the First
    Edition, the Second Edition is organized into three parts. However, each part
    has been expanded to include new chapters or reorganized to incorporate new findings
    and concepts.Part One introduces the idea that synapses modified by experience
    provide the basis for memory storage. It next describes the long-term potentiation
    methodology used to study how synapses are modified and concepts needed to understand
    the organization of synapses. The remaining chapters are organized around the
    idea that the synaptic changes that support long-term potentiation evolve in four
    overlapping stages referred to as (a) generation, (b) stabilization, (c) consolidation,
    and (d) maintenance. The goal of each chapter is to reveal that each stage depends
    on unique molecular processes and to describe what they are.Part Two builds on
    this foundation to show how molecules and cellular processes that have been identified
    from studies of synaptic plasticity also participate in the making of memories.
    It discusses some of the basic conceptual issues researchers face in trying to
    relate memory to synaptic molecules and describes some of the behavioral and neurobiological
    methods that are used. The chapters describing the processes involved in memory
    formation and consolidation have been extensively modified to provide a more detailed
    account of the molecular events that are engaged to ensure that established memories
    endure. The chapters on memory modulation and the fate of retrieved memories have
    been extensively modified to provide a more in-depth account of the relevant processes.Part
    Three is organized around the multiple memory systems view–that different neural
    systems have evolved to store the content contained in our experience. It features
    discussion of the medial-temporal hippocampal system that supports episodic memory,
    the concept of systems consolidation, and its relationship to Ribot’s law–that
    memories become resistant to disruption as they age. The cortical-striatal system
    and its relationship to what are called behavioral actions and habits is described,
    and the book ends with a discussion of neural systems involved in the acquisition
    and removal of emotional memories. Previous publication dates April 2008

  container-title: Journal of Experimental Social Psychology
  page: 4-28
  volume: '35'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: When women perform math, unlike men, they risk being judged by the negative
    stereotype that women have weaker math ability. We call this predicamentstereotype
    threatand hypothesize that the apprehension it causes may disrupt women’s math
    performance. In Study 1 we demonstrated that the pattern observed in the literature
    that women underperform on difficult (but not easy) math tests was observed among
    a highly selected sample of men and women. In Study 2 we demonstrated that this
    difference in performance could be eliminated when we lowered stereotype threat
    by describing the test as not producing gender differences. However, when the
    test was described as producing gender differences and stereotype threat was high,
    women performed substantially worse than equally qualified men did. A third experiment
    replicated this finding with a less highly selected population and explored the
    mediation of the effect. The implication that stereotype threat may underlie gender
    differences in advanced math performance, even those that have been attributed
    to genetically rooted sex differences, is discussed.

  abstract: Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use, manipulate and generalize
    knowledge that is acquired over the lifespan to support innumerable verbal and
    non-verbal behaviours. This Review summarizes key findings and issues arising
    from a decade of research into the neurocognitive and neurocomputational underpinnings
    of this ability, leading to a new framework that we term controlled semantic cognition
    (CSC). CSC offers solutions to long-standing queries in philosophy and cognitive
    science, and yields a convergent framework for understanding the neural and computational
    bases of healthy semantic cognition and its dysfunction in brain disorders.

  container-title: Nature Neuroscience

  page: 1598-1610
  volume: '22'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: 'Long-term memory formation is a major function of sleep. Based on evidence
    from neurophysiological and behavioral studies mainly in humans and rodents, we
    consider the formation of long-term memory during sleep as an active systems consolidation
    process that is embedded in a process of global synaptic downscaling. Repeated
    neuronal replay of representations originating from the hippocampus during slow-wave
    sleep leads to a gradual transformation and integration of representations in
    neocortical networks. We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal
    replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both
    hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations
    hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for
    regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic
    plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation
    resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.'

  volume: '38'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Structural features of interpersonal relationships, particularly competition
    and status, can cause people, respectively, to (dis)like and (dis)respect each
    other, although they think they are reacting to the target’s personality. Two
    studies manipulate structural relationships between students in a 2 2 between-participants
    design. Competition and status, respectively, differentiate perceptions of the
    target’s warmth and competence. In Study 1’s prepost design, the pre- and post-interaction
    warmth, but status affected only pre-interaction competence. Study 2 post-interaction-only
    design did replicate both of Study 1’s pre-interaction results. Competing targets
    were judged less warm than cooperating targets; high-status targets were judged
    more competent than low-status targets. These experiments demonstrate the structural
    predictors of the intergroup stereotype content model at the interpersonal level.

  abstract: |-
    Consciousness is traditionally defined in mental or psychological terms. In trying to find its neural basis, introspective or behavioral observations are considered the gold standard, to which neural measures should be fitted. I argue that this poses serious problems for understanding the mind\
    textendash brain relationship. To solve these problems, neural and behavioral measures should be put on an equal footing. I illustrate this by an example from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent scientific definition of visual consciousness. However, to accept this definition, we need to let go of our intuitive or psychological notions of conscious experience and let the neuroscience arguments have their way. Only by moving our notion of mind towards that of brain can progress be made.

  title: How and why do infants imitate? An ideomotor approach to social and imitative
    learning in infancy (and beyond)
  title-short: How and why do infants imitate?
  container-title: Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
  page: 1139-1156
  volume: '21'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: |-
    It has been proposed that already in infancy, imitative learning plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of knowledge and abilities. Yet the cognitive mechanisms underlying the acquisition of novel action knowledge through social learning have remained unclear. The present contribution presents an ideomotor approach to imitative learning (IMAIL) in infancy (and beyond) that draws on the ideomotor theory of action control and on recent findings of perception\
    textendash action matching. According to IMAIL, the central mechanism of imitative and social learning is the acquisition of cascading bidirectional action\
    textendash effect associations through observation of own and others’ actions. First, the observation of the visual effect of own actions leads to the acquisition of first-order action\
    textendash effect associations, linking motor codes to the action’s typical visual effects. Second, observing another person’s action leads to motor activation (i.e., motor resonance) due to the first-order associations. This activated motor code then becomes linked to the other salient effects produced by the observed action, leading to the acquisition of (second-order) action\
    textendash effect associations. These novel action\
    textendash effect associations enable later imitation of the observed actions. The article reviews recent behavioral and neurophysiological studies with infants and adults that provide empirical support for the model. Furthermore, it is discussed how the model relates to other approaches on social-cognitive development and how developmental changes in imitative abilities can be conceptualized.

  container-title: Philosophical Psychology
  publisher: Routledge
  page: 341-364
  volume: '25'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: This paper offers an epistemological discussion of self-validating belief
    systems and the recurrence of “epistemic defense mechanisms” and “immunizing strategies”
    across widely different domains of knowledge. We challenge the idea that typical
    “weird” belief systems are inherently fragile, and we argue that, instead, they
    exhibit a surprising degree of resilience in the face of adverse evidence and
    criticism. Borrowing from the psychological research on belief perseverance, rationalization
    and motivated reasoning, we argue that the human mind is particularly susceptible
    to belief systems that are structurally self-validating. On this cognitive-psychological
    basis, we construct an epidemiology of beliefs, arguing that the apparent convenience
    of escape clauses and other defensive “tactics” used by believers may well derive
    not from conscious deliberation on their part, but from more subtle mechanisms
    of cultural selection.

    measures such as the Big Five personality dimensions and locus of control were
    measured in conjunction with standard political interest variables such as political
    cynicism and political information efficacy. The results indicate supporters for
    the two major parties are wired differently, in line with previous findings about
    ideology. Democrats were driven by an external locus of control and Republicans
    by an internal locus. This research finds self-identified Independents as truly

  title: Dreaming and Offline Memory Consolidation
  container-title: Current neurology and neuroscience reports
  page: '433'
  volume: '14'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Converging evidence suggests that dreaming is influenced by the consolidation
    of memory during sleep. Following encoding, recently formed memory traces are
    gradually stabilized and reorganized into a more permanent form of long-term storage.
    Sleep provides an optimal neurophysiological state to facilitate this process,
    allowing memory networks to be repeatedly reactivated in the absence of new sensory
    input. The process of memory reactivation and consolidation in the sleeping brain
    appears to influence conscious experience during sleep, contributing to dream
    content recalled on awakening. This article outlines several lines of evidence
    in support of this hypothesis, and responds to some common objections.

  title: A network theory of mental disorders
  container-title: World Psychiatry
  page: 5-13
  volume: '16'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced
    as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental
    disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network
    approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it
    has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders.
    The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set
    of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks.
    At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are
    causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms.
    If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level
    of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get
    stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature
    of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states
    of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive
    model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders,
    as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience,
    vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications
    for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for
    future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.

  container-title: PLOS Biology

  page: e302
  volume: '4'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: |-
    The emergence of social behaviors early in life is likely crucial for the development of mother\
    textendash infant relationships. Some of these behaviors, such as the capacity of neonates to imitate adult facial movements, were previously thought to be limited to humans and perhaps the ape lineage. Here we report the behavioral responses of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) to the following human facial and hand gestures: lip smacking, tongue protrusion, mouth opening, hand opening, and opening and closing of eyes (control condition). In the third day of life, infant macaques imitate lip smacking and tongue protrusion. On the first day of life, the model’s mouth openings elicited a similar matched behavior (lip smacking) in the infants. These imitative responses are present at an early stage of development, but they are apparently confined to a narrow temporal window. Because lip smacking is a core gesture in face-to-face interactions in macaques, neonatal imitation may serve to tune infants’ affiliative responses to the social world. Our findings provide a quantitative description of neonatal imitation in a nonhuman primate species and suggest that these imitative capacities, contrary to what was previously thought, are not unique to the ape and human lineage. We suggest that their evolutionary origins may be traced to affiliative gestures with communicative functions.

  abstract: Dominance hierarchies exist in numerous social species, and rank in such
    hierarchies can dramatically influence the quality of an individual’s life. Rank
    can dramatically influence also the health of an individual, particularly with
    respect to stress-related disease. This chapter reviews first the nature of stress,
    the stress-response and stress-related disease, as well as the varieties of hierarchical
    systems in animals. I then review the literature derived from nonhuman species
    concerning the connections between rank and functioning of the adrenocortical,
    cardiovascular, reproductive, and immune systems. As shown here, the relationship
    is anything but monolithic. Finally, I consider whether rank is a relevant concept
    in humans and argue that socioeconomic status (SES) is the nearest human approximation
    to social rank and that SES dramatically influences health. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract: |-
    The Abridged Big Five-Dimensional Circumplex (AB5C) Model of Hofstee, De Raad and Goldberg (1992) represents trait terms as blends of factors. Analyses suggest that different scales for measuring Factor V (Mentality) may reflect blends of this factor with either Factor 111 (Constraint) or Factor I (Extraversion/Surgency). Measures saturated primarily by Factor V alone (V+V+ in the AB5C terms of Hofstee et al.) represent Creative Mentality. Measures that blend Factor V with the positive pole of Factor III represent Constrained Mentality (V+III+ ), with the negative pole, Unconstrained Mentality (V+III\
    textendash ). Measures that blend Factors V and I represent Surgent Mentality (V+I+). While all of these variants are perfectly valid forms of Factor V, Creative Mentality seems to be the central core of Factor V and is represented by the Openness to Ideas and Openness to Aesthetics Scales of Costa and McCrae (1992) and by the Generates Ideas and Culture Scales of Hogan and Hogan (1992).

  title: Deep Predictive Learning in Neocortex and Pulvinar
  container-title: arXiv:2006.14800 \[q-bio\]
  abstract: How does the human brain learn new concepts from raw sensory experience,
    without explicit instruction? We still do not have a widely-accepted answer to
    this central question. Here, we propose a detailed biological mechanism for the
    widely-embraced idea that learning is based on the differences between predictions
    and actual outcomes (i.e., predictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous
    weak projections into the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions,
    and sparse, focal driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating
    in layer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly
    activated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal
    difference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the neocortex,
    resulting in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation learning.
    We implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual system, and
    found that the simulated inferotemporal (IT) pathway learns to systematically
    categorize 3D objects according to invariant shape properties, based solely on
    predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories match human judgments
    on the same stimuli, and are consistent with neural representations in IT cortex
    in primates.

  abstract: Two studies explored the conditions under which social comparisons are

    mood and dispositional self-esteem as determinants of affective responses to upward
    and downward comparisons. Consistent with a mood repair prediction, only low-self-esteem
    Ss in whom a negative mood had been induced reported improved mood after exposure
    to downward comparison information. Study 2 examined the impact of naturalistic
    threats on responses to comparison information. Relative to a no-comparison baseline,
    low-self-esteem Ss who had experienced a recent academic setback reported more
    favorable self-evaluations and greater expectations of future success in college
    after exposure to downward comparison information. These results remained significant
    after controlling statistically for general distress. Implications for downward
    comparison theory are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

  abstract: A general theory of domain identification is used to describe achievement
    barriers still faced by women in advanced quantitative areas and by African Americans
    in school. The theory assumes that sustained school success requires identification
    with school and its subdomains; that societal pressures on these groups (e.g.,
    economic disadvantage, gender roles) can frustrate this identification; and that
    in school domains where these groups are negatively stereotyped, those who have
    become domain identified face the further barrier of stereotype threat, the threat
    that others’ judgments or their own actions will negatively stereotype them in
    the domain. Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized
    test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard
    of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized
    test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices
    that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects. (PsycINFO Database

  abstract: '\[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online
    in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology on Apr 18 2019 (see record 2019-21976-001).
    In the fourth paragraph of the Status Predicts Competence, and Competition Predicts
    Warmth section, the results are worded in a confusing way, and some values are
    wrong. In the fourth paragraph’s first sentence, all correlation coefficients
    mistakenly omitted the negative sign implied in the text (“negatively correlated”)
    and shown in the correct values reported in Table 6. The text should appear instead
    as follows: Perceived competition negatively correlated with perceived warmth
    for the student sample, group-level r(21) .68, p r(71) .22, p r(21) .53, p r(36)
    .11, ns.\] Stereotype research emphasizes systematic processes over seemingly
    arbitrary contents, but content also may prove systematic. On the basis of stereotypes’
    intergroup functions, the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (1) 2 primary
    dimensions are competence and warmth, (2) frequent mixed clusters combine high
    warmth with low competence (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth
    (envious), and (3) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, contempt) differentiate
    the 4 competence-warmth combinations. Stereotypically, (4) status predicts high
    competence, and competition predicts low warmth. Nine varied samples rated gender,
    ethnicity, race, class, age, and disability out-groups. Contrary to antipathy
    models, 2 dimensions mattered, and many stereotypes were mixed, either pitying
    (low competence, high warmth subordinates) or envying (high competence, low warmth
    competitors). Stereotypically, status predicted competence, and competition predicted
    low warmth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)'

  page: 33-73
  volume: '24'

  abstract: When asked to recall their earliest personal memories, most children and
    adults have virtually no recollection of their infancy or early childhood. This
    phenomenon is commonly referred to as childhood amnesia. The fate of our earliest
    memories has puzzled psychologists for over 50 years, particularly in light of
    the importance of early experience in human development. Empirical research has
    shown that infants can both learn and remember very early in development, making
    the ultimate fate of early memories even more mysterious. The theoretical explanation
    of childhood amnesia outlined here relies on age-related changes in encoding,
    retention, and retrieval that occur during infancy and early childhood. Data obtained
    using a host of different memory tasks support the conclusion that quantitative
    changes in these basic memory processes can account for the decline of childhood
    amnesia during the third or fourth year of life.

  abstract: Two experiments are reported in which subjects viewed films of automobiled

    question, “About how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?”
    elicited higher estimates of speed than questions which used the verbs collided,
    bumped, contacted, or hit in place of smashed. On a retest one week later, those
    subjects who received the verb smashed were more likely to say “yes” to the question,
    “Did you see any broken glass?”, even though broken glass was not present in the
    film. These results are consistent with the view that the questions asked subsequent
    to an event can cause a reconstruction in one’s memory of that event.

  container-title: Nature

  page: 137-140
  volume: '415'
  issue: '6868'
  abstract: Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people
    frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups,
    with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or
    absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives
    associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives
    associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we
    show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive
    for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals
    punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain.
    We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and
    breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions
    towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These
    results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should
    include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.

  abstract: In many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines,
    women are outperformed by men in test scores, jeopardizing their success in science-oriented
    courses and careers. The current study tested the effectiveness of a psychological
    intervention, called values affirmation, in reducing the gender achievement gap
    in a college-level introductory physics class. In this randomized double-blind
    study, 399 students either wrote about their most important values or not, twice
    at the beginning of the 15-week course. Values affirmation reduced the male-female
    performance and learning difference substantially and elevated women’s modal grades
    from the C to B range. Benefits were strongest for women who tended to endorse
    the stereotype that men do better than women in physics. A brief psychological
    intervention may be a promising way to address the gender gap in science performance
    and learning. A writing exercise improves the performance of female physics students.

  chapter-number: '9'
  abstract: The interpersonal theory of personality, originating with the works of
    Sullivan, Leary, and Schaefer, is reviewed, and it is suggested that an interpersonal
    focus can serve as the basis for integrating diverse theoretical approaches to
    personality. Interpersonal theory’s emphasis on the “interpersonal situation”
    includes both proximal description of overt behavioral transaction and covert
    psychological processes that mediate interaction, including the formation and
    function of internalized mental representations of self and other. Interpersonal
    theory’s unique contributions to personality include well-articulated structural
    models to describe interpersonal behavior and the patterned regularity of human
    transaction and recognition of the reciprocal field regulatory functions of interpersonal
    behavior. Motivational and developmental concepts and processes require further
    development. We assert that a comprehensive interpersonal theory requires integration
    with attachment, object relations, and cognitive theories of human behavior and
    development. Recent theoretical developments such as Kiesler’s “impact message”
    and Benjamin’s “gift of love” theory of psychopathology begin such integrative
    steps. We argue that an even broader range of human motives across the lifespan
    be linked to interpersonal functioning than is currently found in the literature.
    In addition, identification of the catalysts that stimulate internalization of
    relational experience into influential mental representations is needed in an
    interpersonal theory of personality development.

  abstract: |-
    The present study explored longitudinal evidence for prodromal symptoms of depression episodes. A model based on previous findings of the relations between prodromal and residual symptoms was described and used to generate hypotheses tested in this study. Data were analyzed from 160 participants from the Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression (CVD) project (L. Alloy\
    & L. Abramson, 1999) who experienced an episode of depression during the prospective follow-up period and 60 CVD participants who did not. Congruent with the hypothesis, individuals who subsequently developed an episode of depression experienced significantly greater numbers of depression symptoms in the period of time leading up to the acute episode compared with those who did not develop a depressive episode. Seven depression symptoms were particularly likely to appear before the onset of an acute episode. Furthermore, all 3 predictions from the model were supported: the durations of prodromal and residual phases were correlated, the prodromal and residual symptom profiles were quite similar, and the order of symptom onset was significantly and highly negatively correlated with the order of symptom remission. Additionally, residual symptom profiles were similar to subsequent prodromal symptom profiles in individuals who experienced more than 1 depressive episode. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of understanding the earliest prodromal symptoms to appear and their relation to the symptomatic course of depression episodes. Implications for early intervention are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

  page: 307-321
  volume: '17'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: The neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC) are the minimum neuronal
    mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious experience. It is
    important to distinguish full NCC (the neural substrate supporting experience
    in general, irrespective of its specific content), content-specific NCC (the neural
    substrate supporting a particular content of experience for example, faces, whether
    seen, dreamt or imagined) and background conditions (factors that enable consciousness,
    but do not contribute directly to the content of experience for example, arousal
    systems that ensure adequate excitability of the NCC).The no-report paradigm allows
    the NCC to be distinguished from events or processes such as selective attention,
    memory and response preparation that are associated with, precede or follow conscious
    experience. In such paradigms, trials with explicit reports are included along
    with trials without explicit reports, during which indirect physiological measures
    are used to infer what the participant is perceiving.The best candidates for full
    and content-specific NCC are located in the posterior cerebral cortex, in a temporo-parietal-occipital
    hot zone. The content-specific NCC may be any particular subset of neurons within
    this hot zone that supports specific phenomenological distinctions, such as faces.The
    two most widely used electrophysiological signatures of consciousness gamma range
    oscillations and the P3b event-related potential can be dissociated from conscious
    experiences and are more closely correlated with selective attention and novelty,
    respectively.New electroencephalography- or functional MRI-based variables that
    measure the extent to which neuronal activity is both differentiated and integrated
    across the cortical sheet allow the NCC to be identified more precisely. Moreover,
    a combined transcranial magnetic stimulationelectroencephalography procedure can
    predict the presence or absence of consciousness in healthy people who are awake,
    deeply sleeping or under different types of anaesthesia, and in patients with
    disorders of consciousness, at the single-person level.Extending the NCC derived
    from studies in people who can speak about the presence and quality of consciousness
    to patients with severe brain injuries, fetuses and newborn infants, non-mammalian
    species and intelligent machines is more challenging. For these purposes, it is
    essential to combine experimental studies to identify the NCC with a theoretical
    approach that characterizes in a principled manner what consciousness is and what
    is required of its physical substrate.

  page: 19-23
  volume: '11'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Performance on measures of working memory (WM) capacity predicts performance
    on a wide range of real-world cognitive tasks. I review the idea that WM capacity
    (a) is separable from short-term memory, (b) is an important component of general
    fluid intelligence, and (c) represents a domain-free limitation in ability to
    control attention. Studies show that individual differences in WM capacity are
    reflected in performance on antisaccade, Stroop, and dichotic-listening tasks.
    WM capacity, or executive attention, is most important under conditions in which
    interference leads to retrieval of response tendencies that conflict with the
    current task.

  title: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners
  container-title: arXiv:2005.14165 \[cs\]
  abstract: Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks
    by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific
    task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires
    task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples.
    By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few
    examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still
    largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves
    task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with
    prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an
    autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous
    non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For
    all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
    tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the
    model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
    question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly
    reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
    in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify
    some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some
    datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large
    web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles
    which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by
    humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.

  container-title: Neuroscience
  page: 551-570
  volume: '31'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus
    suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons
    and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells
    reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities,
    while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory
    behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves
    reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells
    in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting
    CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region
    is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the
    experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency,
    and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold)
    suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population
    bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population
    bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets,
    (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst,
    and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine
    which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts
    (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model
    of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the
    neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing
    granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation
    in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will
    then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp
    wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst
    is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested
    that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population
    bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient
    for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons
    of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory
    (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference
    that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes)
    is detrimental to memory trace formation.

  title: 'Episodic textendash like memory in animals: Psychological criteria, neural
    mechanisms and the value of episodic textendash like tasks to investigate animal
    models of neurodegenerative disease'
  title-short: Episodic textendash like memory in animals
  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 1453-1465
  volume: '356'
  issue: '1413'
  abstract: The question of whether any nonhuman species displays episodic memory
    is controversial. Associative accounts of animal learning recognize that behaviour
    can change in response to single events but this does not imply that animals need
    or are later able to recall representations of unique events at a different time
    and place. The lack of language is also relevant, being the usual medium for communicating
    about the world, but whether it is critical for the capacity to represent and
    recall events is a separate matter. One reason for suspecting that certain animals
    possess an episodiclike memory system is that a variety of learning and memory
    tasks have been developed that, even though they do not meet the strict criteria
    required for episodic memory, have an ‘episodiclike’ character. These include
    certain onetrial learning tasks, scenespecific discrimination learning, multiple
    reversal learning, delayed matching and nonmatching tasks and, most recently,
    tasks demanding recollection of ‘what, where and when’ an event happened. Another
    reason is that the neuronal architecture of brain areas thought to be involved
    in episodic memory (including the hippocampal formation) are substantially similar
    in mammals and, arguably, all vertebrates. Third, our developing understanding
    of activitydependent synaptic plasticity (which is a candidate neuronal mechanism
    for encoding memory traces) suggests that its expression reflects certain physiological
    characteristics that are ideal components of a neuronal episodic memory system.
    These include the apparently digital character of synaptic change at individual
    terminals and the variable persistence of potentiation accounted for by the synaptic
    tag hypothesis. A further value of studying episodiclike memory in animals is
    the opportunity it affords to model certain kinds of neurodegenerative disease
    that, in humans, affect episodic memory. An example is recent work on a transgenic
    mouse that overexpresses a mutation of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) that
    occurs in familial Alzheimer’s disease, under the control of platelet derived
    (PD) growth factor promoter (the PDAPP mouse). A striking age and amyloid plaquerelated
    deficit is seen using a task in which the mice have to keep changing their memory
    representation of the world rather than learn a single fact.

  title: Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean
  container-title: Current Directions in Psychological Science
  page: 160-164
  volume: '9'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Behavior genetics has demonstrated that genetic variance is an important
    component of variation for all behavioral outcomes, but variation among families
    is not. These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that
    heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding
    of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family
    environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are
    incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment,
    but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is
    fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally.
    Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes
    are more fundamental than environments.

  title: Quantifying and Addressing Parameter Indeterminacy in the Classical Twin
    Design
  container-title: Twin Research and Human Genetics
  page: 201-213
  volume: '8'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The classical twin design (CTD) is the most common method used to infer
    genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic variation. As has long been acknowledged,
    different combinations of the common environment/assortative mating, and additive,
    dominant, and epistatic genetic effects can lead to the same observed covariation
    between twin pairs, meaning that there is an inherent indeterminacy in parameter
    estimates arising from the CTD. The CTD circumvents this indeterminacy by assuming
    that higher-order epistasis is negligible and that the effects of either dominant
    genetic variation or the common environment are nonexistent. These assumptions,
    however, lead to consistent biases in parameter estimation. The current paper
    quantifies these biases and discusses alternative strategies for dealing with
    parameter indeterminacy in twin designs. One strategy is to model the similarity
    among other relatives in addition to twins (extended twin-family designs), which
    reduces but does not eliminate indeterminacy in parameter estimates. A more general
    strategy, applicable to all twin designs, is to present the parameter indeterminacy
    explicitly, as in a graph. Presenting the space of mathematically equally likely
    parameter values is important, not only because it aids the proper interpretation
    of twin design findings, but also because it keeps behavioral geneticists themselves
    mindful of methodological assumptions that can easily go unexamined.

  volume: 154, Part A
  abstract: |-
    A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). V1 neurons respond best to oriented stimuli of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) center. This size tuning is contrast dependent, i.e. a neuron’s optimal stimulus size measured at high contrast (the high-contrast summation RF, or hsRF) is smaller than when measured using low-contrast stimuli (the low-contrast summation RF, or lsRF). Responses to stimuli in the RF center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the extra-classical RF surround. Iso-orientation surround suppression is fast and long range, extending well beyond the size of V1 cells’ lsRF. Geniculocortical feedforward (FF), V1 lateral and extrastriate feedback (FB) connections to V1 could all contribute to generating the RF center and surround of V1 neurons. Studies on the spatio-temporal properties and functional organization of these connections can help disclose their specific contributions to the responses of V1 cells. These studies, reviewed in this chapter, have shown that FF afferents to V1 integrate signals within the hsRF of V1 cells; V1 lateral connections are commensurate with the size of the lsRF and may, thus, underlie contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation, and modulatory effects arising from the surround region closer to the RF center (the “near” surround). The spatial and temporal properties of lateral connections cannot account for the dimensions and onset latency of modulation arising from more distant regions of the surround (the “far” surround). Inter-areal FB connections to V1, instead, are commensurate with the full spatial range of center and surround responses, and show fast conduction velocity consistent with the short onset latency of modulation arising from the “far” surround. We review data showing that a subset of FB connections terminate in a patchy fashion in V1, and show modular and orientation specificity, consistent with their proposed role in orientation-specific center\
    textendash surround interactions. We propose specific mechanisms by which each connection type contributes to the RF center and surround of V1 neurons, and implement these hypotheses into a recurrent network model. We show physiological data in support of the model’s predictions, revealing that modulation from the “far” surround is not always suppressive, but can be facilitatory under specific stimulus conditions.

  page: 388-407
  volume: '3'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In this paper we review the factors alleged to be responsible for the
    creation of inaccurate reports among preschool-aged children, focusing on so-called
    "source misattribution errors." We present the first round of results from an
    ongoing program of research that suggests that source misattributions could be
    a powerful mechanism underlying children${'}$s false beliefs about having experienced
    fictitious events. Preliminary findings from this program of research indicate
    that all children of all ages are equally susceptible to making source misattributions.
    Data from a follow-up wave of data indicate that very young children may be disproportionately
    vulnerable to these kinds of errors when the procedure is changed slightly to
    create mental images more easily. This vulnerability leads younger preschoolers,
    on occasion, to claim that they actually experienced events that they only thought
    about. These preliminary findings are discussed in the context of the ongoing
    debate over the veracity and durability of delayed reports of early memories,
    repressed memories, dissociative states, and the validity risks posed by therapeutic
    techniques that entail repeated visually guided imagery inductions.

  publisher: Penguin
  abstract: '"The Knowledge Illusion is filled with insights on how we should deal
    with our individual ignorance and collective wisdom." –Steven Pinker We all think
    we know more than we actually do. Humans have built hugely complex societies and
    technologies, but most of us don’t even know how a pen or a toilet works. How
    have we achieved so much despite understanding so little? Cognitive scientists
    Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach argue that we survive and thrive despite our
    mental shortcomings because we live in a rich community of knowledge. The key
    to our intelligence lies in the people and things around us. We’re constantly
    drawing on information and expertise stored outside our heads: in our bodies,
    our environment, our possessions, and the community with which we interact–and
    usually we don’t even realize we’re doing it. The human mind is both brilliant
    and pathetic. We have mastered fire, created democratic institutions, stood on
    the moon, and sequenced our genome. And yet each of us is error prone, sometimes
    irrational, and often ignorant. The fundamentally communal nature of intelligence
    and knowledge explains why we often assume we know more than we really do, why
    political opinions and false beliefs are so hard to change, and why individual-oriented
    approaches to education and management frequently fail. But our collaborative
    minds also enable us to do amazing things. The Knowledge Illusion contends that
    true genius can be found in the ways we create intelligence using the community
    around us.'

  abstract: 'How much can be seen in a single brief exposure? This is an important
    problem because our normal mode of seeing greatly resembles a sequence of brief
    exposures. In this report, the following experiments were conducted to study quantitatively
    the information that becomes available to an observer following a brief exposure.
    Lettered stimuli were chosen because these contain a relatively large amount of
    information per item and because these are the kind of stimuli that have been
    used by most previous investigators. The first two experiments are essentially
    control experiments; they attempt to confirm that immediate-memory for letters
    is independent of the parameters of stimulation, that it is an individual characteristic.
    In the third experiment the number of letters available immediately after the
    extinction of the stimulus is determined by means of a sampling (partial report)
    procedure described. The fourth experiment explores decay of available information
    with time. The fifth experiment examines some exposure parameters. In the sixth
    experiment a technique which fails to demonstrate a large amount of available
    information is investigated. The seventh experiment deals with the role of the
    historically important variable: order of report. It was found that each observer
    was able to report only a limited number of symbols correctly. For exposure durations
    from 15 to 500 msec, the average was slightly over four letters; stimuli having
    four or fewer letters were reported correctly nearly 100\'

  title: 'Mindset: The New Psychology of Success'
  title-short: Mindset
  publisher: Ballantine Books
  abstract: 'Now updated with new research, the book that has changed millions of
    lives with its insights into the growth mindset. After decades of research, world-renowned
    Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but
    groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how
    success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor
    can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
    People with a fixed mindset–those who believe that abilities are fixed–are less
    likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset–those who believe that abilities
    can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes
    can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition,
    Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She
    introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward

  abstract: The missing heritability problem refers to the gap between heritability
    estimates for complex human traits based on quantitative genetics and the small
    magnitude and unreliability of contemporary molecular genetics, especially genome
    wide association studies. The author reviews the origins of the missing heritability
    problem and considers research that has attempted to resolve it by quantifying
    the joint explanatory power of multiple genetic loci, rather than considering
    their effects one at a time. Although this program has made an important contribution
    to understanding the role of genetics in the development of complex behaviors,
    it does not resolve the missing heritability problem.

  page: 84-103
  volume: '55'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: |-
    The neuropsychological bases of cognitive, social, and moral development are minimally understood, with a seemingly wide chasm between developmental theories and brain maturation models. As one approach to bridging ideas in these areas, we review 10 cases of early prefrontal cortex damage from the clinical literature, highlighting overall clinical profiles and real life developmental outcomes. Based on these cases, there is preliminary evidence to support distinctive developmental differences after: (1) dorsolateral, (2) mesial, and (3) orbital-polar prefrontal lesions, for more profound impairments after bilateral damage, and possibly for recovery differences after very early vs. later childhood lesion onset. Further case and group studies are needed to confirm reliable effects of specific lesion locations, the influence of age of lesion onset, and related experiential and treatment variables in determining adult outcomes. Rather than a single underlying deficit associated with early prefrontal cortex damage, we interpret the findings to suggest that it is the altered integration and interplay of cognitive, emotional, self-regulatory, and executive/metacognitive deficits that contribute to diverse developmental frontal lobe syndromes. The findings support the fundamental importance of prefrontal cortex maturation in protracted cognitive, social\
    textendash emotional, and moral development.

  abstract: An implicit association test (IAT) measures differential association of
    2 target concepts with an attribute. The 2 concepts appear in a 2-choice task
    (e.g., flower vs. insect names), and the attribute in a 2nd task (e.g., pleasant
    vs. unpleasant words for an evaluation attribute). When instructions oblige highly
    associated categories (e.g., flower + pleasant) to share a response key, performance
    is faster than when less associated categories (e.g., insect + pleasant) share
    a key. This performance difference implicitly measures differential association
    of the 2 concepts with the attribute. In 3 experiments, the IAT was sensitive
    to (a) near-universal evaluative differences (e.g., flower vs. insect), (b) expected
    individual differences in evaluative associations (Japanese + pleasant vs. Korean
    + pleasant for Japanese vs. Korean subjects), and (c) consciously disavowed evaluative
    differences (Black + pleasant vs. White + pleasant for self-described unprejudiced
    White subjects). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

  title: Developmental Sequences within and between Concepts
  container-title: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development
  page: 1-84
  volume: '46'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'The purpose of this Monograph is to describe and illustrate a new research
    strategy for studying developmental sequences, the rule-assessment approach. The
    approach begins with a distinction between two types of developmental sequences:
    within-concept sequences, involving the series of knowledge states leading to
    mastery of particular concepts; and between-concept sequences, involving the order
    in which different concepts are understood. In its assumptions concerning within-concept
    sequences the approach resembles traditional stage models, but in its assumptions
    concerning between-concept sequences it differs from them. Specifically, like
    the stage approaches, it assumes that children progress through a series of discrete
    knowledge states on their way to full understanding of any particular concept,
    but, unlike them, it does not assume great consistency of reasoning across different
    concepts. The rule-assessment strategy also differs in its reliance on patterns
    of non-verbal responses as the primary index of children’s knowledge. Four experiments
    were performed to illustrate the utility of the rule-assessment approach for studying
    developmental sequences across a variety of concepts and over a wide range of
    ages. In experiments 1 and 2, it was applied to three formal operational proportionality
    tasks: the balance scale, projection of shadows, and probability tasks. In experiments
    3 and 4, it was applied to three concrete operational conservation tasks: conservation
    of liquid quantity, solid quantity, and number. On all six tasks, the approach
    was successful in revealing the contents of children’s knowledge at different
    points in their development. On four of the six, the progression of knowledge
    states proved to be quite different from the traditional Piagetian accounts. The
    rule-assessment approach also allowed comparisons of the structure of children’s
    knowledge across the six tasks. Finally, the data obtained in experiments 3 and
    4 were sufficiently different from any collected previously to suggest a new theory
    of conservation acquisition.'

  abstract: The self-serving bias refers to a tendency for people to take personal

    their undesirable outcomes. We review a variety of explanations for this attribution
    bias. Although researchers have historically pitted cognitive and motivational
    explanations for the self-serving bias against one another, cognitive and motivation
    processes often work in tandem to lead people to conclude that they are responsible
    for the desirable but not the undesirable outcomes.

  container-title: Current Opinion in Neurobiology
  collection-title: Neurobiology of Learning and Plasticity
  page: 178-185
  volume: '54'
  abstract: Observational learning occurs when an animal capitalizes on the experience
    of another to change its own behavior in a given context. This form of learning
    is an efficient strategy for adapting to changes in environmental conditions,
    but little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. There is an abundance
    of literature supporting observational learning in humans and other primates,
    and more recent studies have begun documenting observational learning in other
    species such as birds and rodents. The neural mechanisms for observational learning
    depend on the species’ brain organization and on the specific behavior being acquired.
    However, as a general rule, it appears that social information impinges on neural
    circuits for direct learning, mimicking or enhancing neuronal activity patterns
    that function during pavlovian, spatial or instrumental learning. Understanding
    the biological mechanisms for social learning could boost translational studies
    into behavioral interventions for a wide range of learning disorders.

  volume: '47'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Expert and exceptional performance are shown to be mediated by cognitive
    and perceptual-motor skills and by domain-specific physiological and anatomical
    adaptations. The highest levels of human performance in different domains can
    only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate
    practice activities. Laboratory analyses of expert performance in many domains
    such as chess, medicine, auditing, computer programming, bridge, physics, sports,
    typing, juggling, dance, and music reveal maximal adaptations of experts to domain-specific
    constraints. For example, acquired anticipatory skills circumvent general limits
    on reaction time, and distinctive memory skills allow a domain-specific expansion
    of working memory capacity to support planning, reasoning, and evaluation. Many
    of the mechanisms of superior expert performance serve the dual purpose of mediating
    experts’ current performance and of allowing continued improvement of this performance
    in response to informative feedback during practice activities.

    beliefs
  container-title: Science
  page: 110-114
  volume: '354'
  issue: '6308'
  abstract: Apes understand false beliefs We humans tend to believe that our cognitive
    skills are unique, not only in degree, but also in kind. The more closely we look
    at other species, however, the clearer it becomes that the difference is one of
    degree. Krupenye et al. show that three different species of apes are able to
    anticipate that others may have mistaken beliefs about a situation (see the Perspective
    by de Waal). The apes appear to understand that individuals have different perceptions
    about the world, thus overturning the human-only paradigm of the theory of mind.
    Science, this issue p. 110; see also p. 39 Humans operate with a “theory of mind”
    with which they are able to understand that others’ actions are driven not by
    reality but by beliefs about reality, even when those beliefs are false. Although
    great apes share with humans many social-cognitive skills, they have repeatedly
    failed experimental tests of such false-belief understanding. We use an anticipatory
    looking test (originally developed for human infants) to show that three species
    of great apes reliably look in anticipation of an agent acting on a location where
    he falsely believes an object to be, even though the apes themselves know that
    the object is no longer there. Our results suggest that great apes also operate,
    at least on an implicit level, with an understanding of false beliefs. Apes recognize
    that others may have false beliefs. \[Also see Perspective by de Waal\] Apes recognize
    that others may have false beliefs. \[Also see Perspective by de Waal\]

  abstract: 'Criticizes and reformulates the learned helplessness hypothesis. It is
    considered that the old hypothesis, when applied to learned helplessness in humans,
    has 2 major problems: (a) It does not distinguish between cases in which outcomes
    are uncontrollable for all people and cases in which they are uncontrollable only
    for some people (universal vs personal helplessness), and (b) it does not explain
    when helplessness is general and when specific, or when chronic and when acute.
    A reformulation based on a revision of attribution theory is proposed to resolve
    these inadequacies. According to the reformulation, once people perceive noncontingency,
    they attribute their helplessness to a cause. This cause can be stable or unstable,
    global or specific, and internal or external. The attribution chosen influences
    whether expectation of future helplessness will be chronic or acute, broad or
    narrow, and whether helplessness will lower self-esteem or not. The implications
    of this reformulation of human helplessness for the learned helplessness model
    of depression are outlined. (92 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all

  title: Sustained overexpression of neuropeptide S in the amygdala reduces anxiety-like
    behavior in rats
  container-title: Behavioural Brain Research
  page: 28-34
  volume: '367'
  abstract: Neuropeptide S (NPS) has shown anxiolytic-like effects in rodents after
    acute administration, but its long-term effects remain unknown. Gene therapy enables
    the targeted delivery of DNA to cell nuclei, and recombinant adeno-associated
    viral (rAAV) vectors have been identified as suitable tools for stable overexpression.
    Thus, to explore the effects of long-term expression of NPS, the present study
    examined anxiety- and depressive-like effects after rAAV-mediated NPS overexpression
    in the rat amygdala. Compared to rats injected with an empty control vector (rAAV-Empty),
    rAAV-NPS treatment was associated with reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated
    plus maze and light-dark box, but did not affect depressive-like behavior in the
    forced swim test. Importantly, rAAV-NPS did not cause confounding effects on locomotion
    or bodyweight as opposed to currently used anxiolytic drugs. Immunohistochemical
    stainings revealed NPS-positive cells in the central and basolateral region of
    the amygdala in rAAV-NPS but not rAAV-Empty rats, indicating successful transduction.
    Our study provides novel evidence for sustained anxiolytic-like properties of
    NPS by transgenic overexpression. These data suggest that rAAV-NPS application
    deserves further attention as a potential treatment strategy for anxiety in humans.

  title: 'Neuropeptide S-Mediated Control of Fear Expression and Extinction: Role
    of Intercalated GABAergic Neurons in the Amygdala'
  title-short: Neuropeptide S-Mediated Control of Fear Expression and Extinction
  container-title: Neuron
  page: 298-310
  volume: '59'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: A deficient extinction of memory is particularly important in the regime
    of fear, where it limits the beneficial outcomes of treatments of anxiety disorders.
    Fear extinction is thought to involve inhibitory influences of the prefrontal
    cortex on the amygdala, although the detailed synaptic mechanisms remain unknown.
    Here, we report that neuropeptide S (NPS), a recently discovered transmitter of
    ascending brainstem neurons, evokes anxiolytic effects and facilitates extinction
    of conditioned fear responses when administered into the amygdala in mice. An
    NPS receptor antagonist exerts functionally opposing responses, indicating that
    endogenous NPS is involved in anxiety behavior and extinction. Cellularly, NPS
    increases glutamatergic transmission to intercalated GABAergic neurons in the
    amygdala via presynaptic NPS receptors on connected principal neurons. These results
    identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain, a key role of intercalated neurons in
    the amygdala for fear extinction, and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating
    anxiety disorders.

  title: The correspondence bias
  container-title: Psychological Bulletin
  publisher: American Psychological Association
  publisher-place: US
  page: 21-38
  volume: '117'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person’s
    unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained
    by the situations in which they occur. Although this tendency is one of the most
    fundamental phenomena in social psychology, its causes and consequences remain
    poorly understood. This article sketches an intellectual history of the correspondence
    bias as an evolving problem in social psychology, describes 4 mechanisms (lack
    of awareness, unrealistic expectations, inflated categorizations, and incomplete
    corrections) that produce distinct forms of correspondence bias, and discusses
    how the consequences of correspondence-biased inferences may perpetuate such inferences.
