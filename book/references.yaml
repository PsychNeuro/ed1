  title: The neural and computational bases of semantic cognition
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  page: 42-55
  volume: '18'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Semantic cognition refers to our ability to use, manipulate and generalize
    knowledge that is acquired over the lifespan to support innumerable verbal and
    non-verbal behaviours. This Review summarizes key findings and issues arising
    from a decade of research into the neurocognitive and neurocomputational underpinnings
    of this ability, leading to a new framework that we term controlled semantic cognition
    (CSC). CSC offers solutions to long-standing queries in philosophy and cognitive
    science, and yields a convergent framework for understanding the neural and computational
    bases of healthy semantic cognition and its dysfunction in brain disorders.

  title: Mechanisms of systems memory consolidation during sleep
  container-title: Nature Neuroscience

  page: 1598-1610
  volume: '22'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: 'Long-term memory formation is a major function of sleep. Based on evidence
    from neurophysiological and behavioral studies mainly in humans and rodents, we
    consider the formation of long-term memory during sleep as an active systems consolidation
    process that is embedded in a process of global synaptic downscaling. Repeated
    neuronal replay of representations originating from the hippocampus during slow-wave
    sleep leads to a gradual transformation and integration of representations in
    neocortical networks. We highlight three features of this process: (i) hippocampal
    replay that, by capturing episodic memory aspects, drives consolidation of both
    hippocampus-dependent and non-hippocampus-dependent memory; (ii) brain oscillations
    hallmarking slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep that provide mechanisms for
    regulating both information flow across distant brain networks and local synaptic
    plasticity; and (iii) qualitative transformations of memories during systems consolidation
    resulting in abstracted, gist-like representations.'

    discerning than attachment theorists give it credit for. Early-appearing, long-lasting
    personality characteristics, often mistaken for the lingering effects of early
    experiences, are more likely due to genetic influences on personality.

  title: A systems-neuroscience model of phasic dopamine
  abstract: We describe a neurobiologically informed computational model of the phasic
    dopamine signal- ing system that can account for a wider range of phenomena than
    simpler reward prediction error (RPE) accounts. The central feature of this PVLV
    framework is the distinction between a Primary Value (PV) system for anticipating
    the onset of primary rewards (USs), and a Learned Value (LV) system for learning
    about stimuli associated with such rewards (CSs). The LV system corresponds to
    the amygdala and its ability to drive phasic dopamine bursting in midbrain dopamine
    areas, while the PV system represents the ventral striatum (principally the nucleus
    accumbens, NAc), which drives shunting inhibition of dopamine for expected USs
    (via direct inhibitory projections) and phasic pausing for expected USs (via the
    lateral habenula, LHb). We show how our model can account for a range of data
    supporting the separability of these systems, including the non-zero- sum nature
    of CS and US firing, and individual differences in CS-based learning (sign-tracking)
    vs. US-based learning (goal-tracking). A critical feature of both systems is the
    use of opponent- processing pathways that represent the competing strengths of
    the evidence in favor and opposed to specific USs, and we show how these pathways
    can explain a range of important data dissociat- ing the processes involved in
    acquisition vs. extinction conditioning, including rapid reaquisition, reinstatement,
    and renewal. Furthermore, this opponent structure is critical for being able to
    ac- count for the full range of conditioned inhibition phenomena, and the surprisingly
    closely-related paradigm of second-order conditioning. Finally, we show how additional
    separable pathways rep- resenting aversive USs, which largely mirror those for
    appetitive USs, also have some important differences from the positive valence
    case, which allow the model to account for several important phenomena in aversive
    conditioning. Overall, the ability to account for all of these phenomena strongly
    constrains the form of the model, which thus provides a well-validated framework
    for understanding phasic dopamine signaling.

  title: No Genetic Influence for Childhood Behavior Problems From DNA Analysis
  container-title: Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
  page: 1048-1056.e3
  volume: '52'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: |-
    Objective Twin studies of behavior problems in childhood point to substantial genetic influence. It is now possible to estimate genetic influence using DNA alone in samples of unrelated individuals, not relying on family-based designs such as twins. A linear mixed model, which incorporates DNA microarray data, has confirmed twin results by showing substantial genetic influence for diverse traits in adults. Here we present direct comparisons between twin and DNA heritability estimates for childhood behavior problems as rated by parents, teachers, and children themselves. Method Behavior problem data from 2,500 UK-representative 12-year-old twin pairs were used in twin analyses; DNA analyses were based on 1 member of the twin pair with genotype data for 1.7 million DNA markers. Diverse behavior problems were assessed, including autistic, depressive, and hyperactive symptoms. Genetic influence from DNA was estimated using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and the twin estimates of heritability were based on standard twin model fitting. Results Behavior problems in childhood\
    textemdash whether rated by parents, teachers, or children themselves\
    textemdash show no significant genetic influence using GCTA, even though twin study estimates of heritability are substantial in the same sample, and even though both GCTA and twin study estimates of genetic influence are substantial for cognitive and anthropometric traits. Conclusions We suggest that this new type of “missing heritability,” that is, the gap between GCTA and twin study estimates for behavior problems in childhood, is due to nonadditive genetic influence, which will make it more difficult to identify genes responsible for heritability.

  title: Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain
  container-title: Nature
  page: 1102-1107
  volume: '435'
  issue: '7045'
  abstract: It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even
    when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level
    representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear1,2,3,4,5,6.
    In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond
    to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance
    to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12.
    We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL)
    fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes13,14. Here we
    report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by
    strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in
    some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant,
    sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex
    visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.

  volume: '47'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Expert and exceptional performance are shown to be mediated by cognitive
    and perceptual-motor skills and by domain-specific physiological and anatomical
    adaptations. The highest levels of human performance in different domains can
    only be attained after around ten years of extended, daily amounts of deliberate
    practice activities. Laboratory analyses of expert performance in many domains
    such as chess, medicine, auditing, computer programming, bridge, physics, sports,
    typing, juggling, dance, and music reveal maximal adaptations of experts to domain-specific
    constraints. For example, acquired anticipatory skills circumvent general limits
    on reaction time, and distinctive memory skills allow a domain-specific expansion
    of working memory capacity to support planning, reasoning, and evaluation. Many
    of the mechanisms of superior expert performance serve the dual purpose of mediating
    experts’ current performance and of allowing continued improvement of this performance
    in response to informative feedback during practice activities.

  abstract: Two experiments are reported in which subjects viewed films of automobiled

    question, “About how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?”
    elicited higher estimates of speed than questions which used the verbs collided,
    bumped, contacted, or hit in place of smashed. On a retest one week later, those
    subjects who received the verb smashed were more likely to say “yes” to the question,
    “Did you see any broken glass?”, even though broken glass was not present in the
    film. These results are consistent with the view that the questions asked subsequent
    to an event can cause a reconstruction in one’s memory of that event.

  abstract: Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple
    processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction.
    These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition,
    visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug
    discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data
    sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change
    its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer
    from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought
    about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent
    nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.

  container-title: Psychological Review
  page: 143-164
  volume: '103'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The developmental theory of Jean Piaget has been criticized on the grounds
    that it is conceptually limited, empirically false, or philosophically and epistemologically
    untenable. This study attempts to rebut these criticisms by showing that most
    of them (a) derive from widespread misinterpretations of the work of Piaget; (b)
    fail to appreciate the 2 central issues of his thinkinghow new forms of thinking
    emerge during ontogenesis and how they become psychologically necessary; (c) incorrectly
    assume that many controversies concerning his theory can be settled empirically
    or methodologically before they are clarified conceptually; (d) ignore various
    modifications of Piagetian theory, particularly those advanced after 1970; and
    (e) forget the dialectical, constructivist, and developmental nature of Piaget’s
    unique approach to human development. Although the authors do not claim there
    is a "true" Piaget to be discovered, or that the problems with his theory vanish
    when it is better understood, they do claim that important aspects of Piaget’s
    work have not been assimilated by developmental psychologists. (PsycINFO Database

    Is Compartment Restricted'
  title-short: Capture of the Late Phase of Long-Term Potentiation within and across
    the Apical and Basilar Dendritic Compartments of CA1 Pyramidal Neurons
  container-title: Journal of Neuroscience
  page: 256-264
  volume: '26'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Studies in the rodent hippocampus have demonstrated that when the late
    phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is induced in a set of synapses by suprathreshold
    stimulation, L-LTP can also be expressed by other synapses receiving subthreshold
    stimulation, a phenomenon usually referred as “capture of L-LTP.” Because the
    pyramidal neurons in the mammalian hippocampus have both apical and basal dendrites,
    we have now investigated whether capture of L-LTP, previously described only within
    the apical dendritic compartment, can also take place within the basilar dendritic
    compartment and, if so, whether capture can be accomplished from one dendritic
    compartment to the other. We found that capture of L-LTP can also occur within
    the basilar dendritic compartment and that the tagging signal that enables capture
    appears to be the same in both dendritic compartments. However, capture across
    compartments, between the apical and basilar dendrites, follows different rules
    and requires a stronger triggering stimulation than capture within a compartment.
    These results suggest that the tag appears specific to a compartment either apical
    or basilar and that an additional mechanism may be required to capture across
    compartments.

  title: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners
  container-title: arXiv:2005.14165 \[cs\]
  abstract: Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks
    by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific
    task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires
    task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples.
    By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few
    examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still
    largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves
    task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with
    prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an
    autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous
    non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For
    all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with
    tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the
    model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
    question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly
    reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word
    in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify
    some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some
    datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large
    web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles
    which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by
    humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.

  container-title: Trends in Cognitive Sciences
  page: 494-501
  volume: '10'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: |-
    Consciousness is traditionally defined in mental or psychological terms. In trying to find its neural basis, introspective or behavioral observations are considered the gold standard, to which neural measures should be fitted. I argue that this poses serious problems for understanding the mind\
    textendash brain relationship. To solve these problems, neural and behavioral measures should be put on an equal footing. I illustrate this by an example from visual neuroscience, in which both neural and behavioral arguments converge towards a coherent scientific definition of visual consciousness. However, to accept this definition, we need to let go of our intuitive or psychological notions of conscious experience and let the neuroscience arguments have their way. Only by moving our notion of mind towards that of brain can progress be made.

  abstract: The behavioral activation (BA) approach to treating depression has received
    very strong empirical support in the past few years, with results as good or better
    than cognitive therapy and antidepressant medications, even for the most severe
    cases of depression. Seemingly counterintuitive at first blush, this treatment
    does not focus on the notion of "just do it" but takes a comprehensive look at
    contingent relationships in the patient’s life across the full range of behavior,
    cognition, and affect that may be maintaining the depression. As such, this very
    idiographic approach does not prescribe a set number of sessions to accomplish
    certain goals but is very adaptable to the individual with depression. In the
    detailed and very human description of the treatment of "Mark," readers will also
    note a very up-to-date focus on the role of rumination in depression (or worry
    in anxiety) as a fundamentally avoidant technique. The illustration of creative
    therapeutic strategies for activating patients, and the very adaptable and flexible
    nature of BA will be of interest to all therapists treating depression, since
    it may be one of the easiest to learn and most disseminable of evidence-based
    psychological treatments for depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA,

    of rats, monkeys and humans.
  container-title: Cerebral Cortex
  page: 206-219
  volume: '10'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: |-
    This paper reviews architectonic subdivisions and connections of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) in rats, monkeys and humans. Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of ‘medial’ and ‘orbital’ networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory\
    textendash visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to be critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.

  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 1453-1465
  volume: '356'
  issue: '1413'
  abstract: The question of whether any nonhuman species displays episodic memory
    is controversial. Associative accounts of animal learning recognize that behaviour
    can change in response to single events but this does not imply that animals need
    or are later able to recall representations of unique events at a different time
    and place. The lack of language is also relevant, being the usual medium for communicating
    about the world, but whether it is critical for the capacity to represent and
    recall events is a separate matter. One reason for suspecting that certain animals
    possess an episodiclike memory system is that a variety of learning and memory
    tasks have been developed that, even though they do not meet the strict criteria
    required for episodic memory, have an ‘episodiclike’ character. These include
    certain onetrial learning tasks, scenespecific discrimination learning, multiple
    reversal learning, delayed matching and nonmatching tasks and, most recently,
    tasks demanding recollection of ‘what, where and when’ an event happened. Another
    reason is that the neuronal architecture of brain areas thought to be involved
    in episodic memory (including the hippocampal formation) are substantially similar
    in mammals and, arguably, all vertebrates. Third, our developing understanding
    of activitydependent synaptic plasticity (which is a candidate neuronal mechanism
    for encoding memory traces) suggests that its expression reflects certain physiological
    characteristics that are ideal components of a neuronal episodic memory system.
    These include the apparently digital character of synaptic change at individual
    terminals and the variable persistence of potentiation accounted for by the synaptic
    tag hypothesis. A further value of studying episodiclike memory in animals is
    the opportunity it affords to model certain kinds of neurodegenerative disease
    that, in humans, affect episodic memory. An example is recent work on a transgenic
    mouse that overexpresses a mutation of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) that
    occurs in familial Alzheimer’s disease, under the control of platelet derived
    (PD) growth factor promoter (the PDAPP mouse). A striking age and amyloid plaquerelated
    deficit is seen using a task in which the mice have to keep changing their memory
    representation of the world rather than learn a single fact.

  title: Prevalence of Healthy Sleep Duration among Adults–United States, 2014
  container-title: MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report
  page: 137-141
  volume: '65'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: To promote optimal health and well-being, adults aged 18-60 years are
    recommended to sleep at least 7 hours each night (1). Sleeping $<$7 hours per
    night is associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,
    coronary heart disease, stroke, frequent mental distress, and all-cause mortality
    (2-4). Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive performance, which can increase the
    likelihood of motor vehicle and other transportation accidents, industrial accidents,
    medical errors, and loss of work productivity that could affect the wider community
    (5). CDC analyzed data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
    (BRFSS) to determine the prevalence of a healthy sleep duration ($\geq$ 7 hours)
    among 444,306 adult respondents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
    A total of 65.2% of respondents reported a healthy sleep duration; the age-adjusted
    prevalence of healthy sleep was lower among non-Hispanic blacks, American Indians/Alaska
    Natives, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, and multiracial respondents, compared
    with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and Asians. State-based estimates of healthy
    sleep duration prevalence ranged from 56.1% in Hawaii to 71.6% in South Dakota.
    Geographic clustering of the lowest prevalence of healthy sleep duration was observed
    in the southeastern United States and in states along the Appalachian Mountains,
    and the highest prevalence was observed in the Great Plains states. More than
    one third of U.S. respondents reported typically sleeping $<$7 hours in a 24-hour
    period, suggesting an ongoing need for public awareness and public education about
    sleep health; worksite shift policies that ensure healthy sleep duration for shift
    workers, particularly medical professionals, emergency response personnel, and
    transportation industry personnel; and opportunities for health care providers
    to discuss the importance of healthy sleep duration with patients and address
    reasons for poor sleep health.

  title: Functional brain networks related to individual differences in human intelligence
    at rest
  container-title: Scientific Reports
  page: '32328'
  volume: '6'
  abstract: Intelligence is a fundamental ability that sets humans apart from other
    animal species. Despite its importance in defining human behaviour, the neural
    networks responsible for intelligence are not well understood. The dominant view
    from neuroimaging work suggests that intelligent performance on a range of tasks
    is underpinned by segregated interactions in a fronto-parietal network of brain
    regions. Here we asked whether fronto-parietal interactions associated with intelligence
    are ubiquitous, or emerge from more widespread associations in a task-free context.
    First we undertook an exploratory mapping of the existing literature on functional
    connectivity associated with intelligence. Next, to empirically test hypotheses
    derived from the exploratory mapping, we performed network analyses in a cohort
    of 317 unrelated participants from the Human Connectome Project. Our results revealed
    a novel contribution of across-network interactions between default-mode and fronto-parietal
    networks to individual differences in intelligence at rest. Specifically, we found
    that greater connectivity in the resting state was associated with higher intelligence
    scores. Our findings highlight the need to broaden the dominant fronto-parietal
    conceptualisation of intelligence to encompass more complex and context-specific
    network dynamics.

  title: Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean
  container-title: Current Directions in Psychological Science
  page: 160-164
  volume: '9'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Behavior genetics has demonstrated that genetic variance is an important
    component of variation for all behavioral outcomes, but variation among families
    is not. These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that
    heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding
    of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family
    environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are
    incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment,
    but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is
    fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally.
    Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes
    are more fundamental than environments.

    intelligence. I now argue that working memory tasks reflect primarily the maintenance
    of information, whereas fluid intelligence tests reflect primarily the ability
    to disengage from recently attended and no longer useful information. I also point
    out some conclusions in the 2002 article that now appear to be wrong.

  container-title: 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological
    Sciences'
  page: 23-81
  volume: '262'
  issue: '841'
  abstract: It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is
    its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
    general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models
    for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex.
    The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation,
    which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about
    200 out of a population of 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ cells. It is shown
    that if about 10$<$latex$>\$\sphat$5\$$<$/latex$>$ simple representations are
    stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt
    event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is
    made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions
    are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive
    theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given
    of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum,
    the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
    number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification
    of typical archicortical cells is proposed.

  volume: 154, Part A
  abstract: |-
    A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). V1 neurons respond best to oriented stimuli of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) center. This size tuning is contrast dependent, i.e. a neuron’s optimal stimulus size measured at high contrast (the high-contrast summation RF, or hsRF) is smaller than when measured using low-contrast stimuli (the low-contrast summation RF, or lsRF). Responses to stimuli in the RF center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the extra-classical RF surround. Iso-orientation surround suppression is fast and long range, extending well beyond the size of V1 cells’ lsRF. Geniculocortical feedforward (FF), V1 lateral and extrastriate feedback (FB) connections to V1 could all contribute to generating the RF center and surround of V1 neurons. Studies on the spatio-temporal properties and functional organization of these connections can help disclose their specific contributions to the responses of V1 cells. These studies, reviewed in this chapter, have shown that FF afferents to V1 integrate signals within the hsRF of V1 cells; V1 lateral connections are commensurate with the size of the lsRF and may, thus, underlie contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation, and modulatory effects arising from the surround region closer to the RF center (the “near” surround). The spatial and temporal properties of lateral connections cannot account for the dimensions and onset latency of modulation arising from more distant regions of the surround (the “far” surround). Inter-areal FB connections to V1, instead, are commensurate with the full spatial range of center and surround responses, and show fast conduction velocity consistent with the short onset latency of modulation arising from the “far” surround. We review data showing that a subset of FB connections terminate in a patchy fashion in V1, and show modular and orientation specificity, consistent with their proposed role in orientation-specific center\
    textendash surround interactions. We propose specific mechanisms by which each connection type contributes to the RF center and surround of V1 neurons, and implement these hypotheses into a recurrent network model. We show physiological data in support of the model’s predictions, revealing that modulation from the “far” surround is not always suppressive, but can be facilitatory under specific stimulus conditions.

  title: 'Mindset: The New Psychology of Success'
  title-short: Mindset
  publisher: Ballantine Books
  abstract: 'Now updated with new research, the book that has changed millions of
    lives with its insights into the growth mindset. After decades of research, world-renowned
    Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but
    groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how
    success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor
    can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
    People with a fixed mindset–those who believe that abilities are fixed–are less
    likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset–those who believe that abilities
    can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes
    can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment. In this edition,
    Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She
    introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward
    adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept
    beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations.
    With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love–to transform
    their lives and your own. Praise for Mindset "A good book is one whose advice
    you believe. A great book is one whose advice you follow. This is a book that
    can change your life, as its ideas have changed mine."–Robert J. Sternberg, co-author
    of Teaching for Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, and Success "An essential read
    for parents, teachers \[and\] coaches . . . as well as for those who would like
    to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment."–Library Journal (starred
    review) "Everyone should read this book."–Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of
    Made to Stick "One of the most influential books ever about motivation."–Po Bronson,
    author of NurtureShock "If you manage people or are a parent (which is a form
    of managing people), drop everything and read Mindset."–Guy Kawasaki, author of

  title: Sustained overexpression of neuropeptide S in the amygdala reduces anxiety-like
    behavior in rats
  container-title: Behavioural Brain Research
  page: 28-34
  volume: '367'
  abstract: Neuropeptide S (NPS) has shown anxiolytic-like effects in rodents after
    acute administration, but its long-term effects remain unknown. Gene therapy enables
    the targeted delivery of DNA to cell nuclei, and recombinant adeno-associated
    viral (rAAV) vectors have been identified as suitable tools for stable overexpression.
    Thus, to explore the effects of long-term expression of NPS, the present study
    examined anxiety- and depressive-like effects after rAAV-mediated NPS overexpression
    in the rat amygdala. Compared to rats injected with an empty control vector (rAAV-Empty),
    rAAV-NPS treatment was associated with reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated
    plus maze and light-dark box, but did not affect depressive-like behavior in the
    forced swim test. Importantly, rAAV-NPS did not cause confounding effects on locomotion
    or bodyweight as opposed to currently used anxiolytic drugs. Immunohistochemical
    stainings revealed NPS-positive cells in the central and basolateral region of
    the amygdala in rAAV-NPS but not rAAV-Empty rats, indicating successful transduction.
    Our study provides novel evidence for sustained anxiolytic-like properties of
    NPS by transgenic overexpression. These data suggest that rAAV-NPS application
    deserves further attention as a potential treatment strategy for anxiety in humans.

  abstract: The issue of whether sleep is physiologically necessary has been unresolved
    because experiments that reported deleterious effects of sleep deprivation did
    not control for the stimuli used to prevent sleep. In this experiment, however,
    experimental and control rats received the same relatively mild physical stimuli,
    but stimulus presentations were timed to reduce sleep severely in experimental
    rats but not in controls. Experimental rats suffered severe pathology and death;
    control rats did not.

  container-title: Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
  page: 1520-1527
  volume: '23'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Fluctuations in attentional control can lead to failures of working memory
    (WM), in which the subject is no better than chance at reporting items from a
    recent display. In three experiments, we used a whole-report measure of visual
    WM to examine the impact of feedback on the rate of failures. In each experiment,
    subjects remembered an array of colored items across a blank delay, and then reported
    the identity of items using a whole-report procedure. In Experiment 1, we gave
    subjects simple feedback about the number of items they correctly identified at
    the end of each trial. In Experiment 2, we gave subjects additional information
    about the cumulative number of items correctly identified within each block. Finally,
    in Experiment 3, we gave subjects weighted feedback in which poor trials resulted
    in lost points and consistent successful performance received “streak” points.
    Surprisingly, simple feedback (Exp. 1) was ineffective at improving average performance
    or decreasing the rate of poor-performance trials. Simple cumulative feedback
    (Exp. 2) modestly decreased poor-performance trials (by 7\

  title: Heritability of Word Recognition in Middle-Aged Men Varies as a Function
    of Parental Education
  container-title: Behavior Genetics
  page: 417-433
  volume: '35'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Although it is of lifelong importance, reading ability is studied primarily
    in children and adolescents. We examined variation in word recognition in 347
    middle-aged male twin pairs. Overall heritability (a2) was 0.45, and shared environmental
    influences (c2) were 0.28. However, parental education moderated heritability
    such that a2 was 0.21 at the lowest parental education level and 0.69 at the highest
    level; c2 was 0.52 and 0.00, respectively. This constitutes a parental education
    environment interaction. The higher heritability was due to a decrease in the
    magnitude of shared environmental factors, rather than an increase in the magnitude
    of genetic factors. Other cognitive studies have reported gene environment interactions,
    but patterns may differ as a function of age or specific cognitive abilities.
    Our results suggest that shared environmental factors in families with low parental
    education have long-lasting effects on word recognition ability, well beyond any
    critical period for developing reading proficiency.

  title: Do “Brain-Training” Programs Work?
  container-title: Psychological Science in the Public Interest
  page: 103-186
  volume: '17'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In 2014, two groups of scientists published open letters on the efficacy
    of brain-training interventions, or “brain games,” for improving cognition. The
    first letter, a consensus statement from an international group of more than 70
    scientists, claimed that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded
    way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline. Several
    months later, an international group of 133 scientists and practitioners countered
    that the literature is replete with demonstrations of the benefits of brain training
    for a wide variety of cognitive and everyday activities. How could two teams of
    scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting “consensus” views
    about the effectiveness of brain training?, In part, the disagreement might result
    from different standards used when evaluating the evidence. To date, the field
    has lacked a comprehensive review of the brain-training literature, one that examines
    both the quantity and the quality of the evidence according to a well-defined
    set of best practices. This article provides such a review, focusing exclusively
    on the use of cognitive tasks or games as a means to enhance performance on other
    tasks. We specify and justify a set of best practices for such brain-training
    interventions and then use those standards to evaluate all of the published peer-reviewed
    intervention studies cited on the websites of leading brain-training companies
    listed on Cognitive Training Data (www.cognitivetrainingdata.org), the site hosting
    the open letter from brain-training proponents. These citations presumably represent
    the evidence that best supports the claims of effectiveness., Based on this examination,
    we find extensive evidence that brain-training interventions improve performance
    on the trained tasks, less evidence that such interventions improve performance
    on closely related tasks, and little evidence that training enhances performance
    on distantly related tasks or that training improves everyday cognitive performance.
    We also find that many of the published intervention studies had major shortcomings
    in design or analysis that preclude definitive conclusions about the efficacy
    of training, and that none of the cited studies conformed to all of the best practices
    we identify as essential to drawing clear conclusions about the benefits of brain
    training for everyday activities. We conclude with detailed recommendations for
    scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers that, if adopted, would lead to
    better evidence regarding the efficacy of brain-training interventions.

  page: 84-103
  volume: '55'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: |-
    The neuropsychological bases of cognitive, social, and moral development are minimally understood, with a seemingly wide chasm between developmental theories and brain maturation models. As one approach to bridging ideas in these areas, we review 10 cases of early prefrontal cortex damage from the clinical literature, highlighting overall clinical profiles and real life developmental outcomes. Based on these cases, there is preliminary evidence to support distinctive developmental differences after: (1) dorsolateral, (2) mesial, and (3) orbital-polar prefrontal lesions, for more profound impairments after bilateral damage, and possibly for recovery differences after very early vs. later childhood lesion onset. Further case and group studies are needed to confirm reliable effects of specific lesion locations, the influence of age of lesion onset, and related experiential and treatment variables in determining adult outcomes. Rather than a single underlying deficit associated with early prefrontal cortex damage, we interpret the findings to suggest that it is the altered integration and interplay of cognitive, emotional, self-regulatory, and executive/metacognitive deficits that contribute to diverse developmental frontal lobe syndromes. The findings support the fundamental importance of prefrontal cortex maturation in protracted cognitive, social\
    textendash emotional, and moral development.

  container-title: Nature

  volume: '550'
  issue: '7676'
  abstract: |-
    A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100\
    textendash 0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.

  title: Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity
    (readiness-potential). The unconscious initiation of a freely voluntary act
  container-title: 'Brain: A Journal of Neurology'
  page: 623-642
  volume: 106 (Pt 3)
  abstract: The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes
    a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the
    reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of ’wanting’ or
    intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least
    several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act.
    This relationship held even for those series (with ’type II’ RPs) in which subjects
    reported that all of the 40 self-initiated movements in the series appeared ’spontaneously’
    and capriciously. Data were obtained in at least 6 different experimental sessions
    with each of 5 subjects. In series with type II RPs, onset of the main negative
    shift in each RP preceded the corresponding mean W value by an average of about
    350 ms, and by a minimum of about 150 ms. In series with type I RPs, in which
    an experience of preplanning occurred in some of the 40 self-initiated acts, onset
    of RP preceded W by an average of about 800 ms (or by 500 ms, taking onset of
    RP at 90 per cent of its area). Reports of W time depended upon the subject’s
    recall of the spatial ’clock-position’ of a revolving spot at the time of his
    initial awareness of wanting or intending to move. Two different modes of recall
    produced similar values. Subjects distinguished awareness of wanting to move (W)
    from awareness of actually moving (M). W times were consistently and substantially
    negative to, in advance of, mean times reported for M and also those for S, the
    sensation elicited by a task-related skin stimulus delivered at irregular times
    that were unknown to the subject. It is concluded that cerebral initiation of
    a spontaneous, freely voluntary act can begin unconsciously, that is, before there
    is any (at least recallable) subjective awareness that a ’decision’ to act has
    already been initiated cerebrally. This introduces certain constraints on the
    potentiality for conscious initiation and control of voluntary acts.

  title: An information integration theory of consciousness
  container-title: BMC Neuroscience
  page: '42'
  volume: '5'
  abstract: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the
    conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For
    instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such
    as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum?
    And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless
    sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what
    kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the
    brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision
    and audition?

  volume: '31'

  abstract: Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus
    suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons
    and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells
    reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities,
    while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory
    behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves
    reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells
    in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting
    CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region
    is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the
    experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency,
    and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold)
    suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population
    bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population
    bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets,
    (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst,
    and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine
    which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts
    (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model
    of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the
    neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing
    granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation
    in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will
    then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp
    wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst
    is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested
    that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population
    bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient
    for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons
    of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory
    (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference
    that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes)
    is detrimental to memory trace formation.

  publisher-place: New York, NY, US
  abstract: In this volume, Lave and Wenger undertake a radical and important rethinking
    and reformulation of our conception of learning. By placing emphasis on the whole
    person, and by viewing agent, activity, and world as mutually constitutive, they
    give us the opportunity to escape from the tyranny of the assumption that learning
    is the reception of factual knowledge or information. The authors argue that most
    accounts of learning have ignored its quintessentially social character. To make
    the crucial step away from a solely epistemological account of the person, they
    propose that learning is a process of participation in communities of practice,
    participation that is at first legitimately peripheral but that increases gradually
    in engagement and complexity. Learning viewed as situated activity has as its
    central defining characteristic a process that we call legitimate peripheral participation.
    By this we mean to draw attention to the point that learners inevitably participate
    in communities of practitioners and that the mastery of knowledge and skill requires
    newcomers to move toward full participation in the sociocultural practice of a
    community. . . . A person’s intentions to learn are engaged and the meaning of
    learning is configured through the process of becoming a full participant in a
    sociocultural practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

  abstract: IQ predicts many measures of life success, as well as trajectories of
    brain development. Prolonged cortical thickening observed in individuals with
    high IQ might reflect an extended period of synaptogenesis and high environmental
    sensitivity or plasticity. We tested this hypothesis by examining the timing of
    changes in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on IQ as a function
    of IQ score. We found that individuals with high IQ show high environmental influence
    on IQ into adolescence (resembling younger children), whereas individuals with
    low IQ show high heritability of IQ in adolescence (resembling adults), a pattern
    consistent with an extended sensitive period for intellectual development in more-intelligent
    individuals. The pattern held across a cross-sectional sample of almost 11,000
    twin pairs and a longitudinal sample of twins, biological siblings, and adoptive
    siblings.

  title: The human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated functional

  page: 9673-9678
  volume: '102'

  abstract: During performance of attention-demanding cognitive tasks, certain regions
    of the brain routinely increase activity, whereas others routinely decrease activity.
    In this study, we investigate the extent to which this task-related dichotomy
    is represented intrinsically in the resting human brain through examination of
    spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal.
    We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the
    basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations
    between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related
    activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations.
    This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks
    in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which
    to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses
    and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization
    of the brain.

  title: Heritability estimates of the Big Five personality traits based on common
    genetic variants
  container-title: Translational Psychiatry
  page: e604
  volume: '5'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: According to twin studies, the Big Five personality traits have substantial
    heritable components explaining 40% of the variance, but identification of associated
    genetic variants has remained elusive. Consequently, knowledge regarding the molecular
    genetic architecture of personality and to what extent it is shared across the
    different personality traits is limited. Using genomic-relatedness-matrix residual
    maximum likelihood analysis (GREML), we here estimated the heritability of the
    Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
    neuroticism and openness for experience) in a sample of 5011 European adults from
    527 469 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. We tested for the heritability
    of each personality trait, as well as for the genetic overlap between the personality
    factors. We found significant and substantial heritability estimates for neuroticism
    (15%, s.e.=0.08, P=0.04) and openness (21%, s.e.=0.08, P$<$0.01), but not for
    extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. The bivariate analyses showed
    that the variance explained by common variants entirely overlapped between neuroticism
    and openness (rG=1.00, P $<$0.001), despite low phenotypic correlation (r=-0.09,
    P $<$0.001), suggesting that the remaining unique heritability may be determined
    by rare or structural variants. As far as we are aware of, this is the first study
    estimating the shared and unique heritability of all Big Five personality traits
    using the GREML approach. Findings should be considered exploratory and suggest
    that detectable heritability estimates based on common variants is shared between
    neuroticism and openness to experiences.

  page: 679-693
  volume: '3'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: 'Recent studies of sleep that bring closer the development of a cognitive
    neuroscience of conscious states are reviewed to reveal a unique integration of
    mechanistic and functional concepts. The electrophysiology of non-rapid eye movement
    (NREM) sleep has been detailed to reveal the effects of brainstem reticular and
    neuromodulatory deactivation of the thalamocortical system. But instead of viewing
    these changes simply as inactivation, it has been suggested that the slow waves
    and spindles of NREM might reflect a differential mode of information processing
    by the brain in sleep. In particular, these findings are compatible with a two-stage
    hypothesis of sleep enhancement of plasticity a model that is also supported by
    studies of human cognitive enhancement in sleep. The transformational role of
    two methodological innovations is emphasized. Home-based studies of sleep allow
    investigators to obtain vast amounts of data about the kind of consciousness that
    is associated with active waking, quiet waking, sleep onset, NREM and REM sleep.
    At the same time, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is used to reveal
    the relative blood flow in different regions of the human brain in waking, NREM
    and REM sleep. The data from these two sources are complementary and informative.
    For example, in REM sleep (compared with waking) there is more blood flow directed
    towards the brain stem, the limbic forebrain and the parietal operculum; these
    findings map onto the marked increase in hallucinatory experience during REM.
    By contrast, the low levels of thinking during REM map onto the decrease in dorsolateral
    prefrontal cortical blood flow in that state. The relevance of these findings
    to the brain-based activationsynthesis theory of dreaming is stressed by a systematic
    review of the differential increases in activation of forebrain structures revealed
    by PET imaging in: ascending arousal systems; thalamocortical and thalamic subcortical
    structures; limbic and paralimbic structures; motor initiation and control areas;
    visual association cortex; and the inferior parietal lobe. Plasticity is now thought
    to be a major functional process that is generated by sleep. This idea is supported
    by recent developmental and human memory studies. The human cognitive studies
    reveal enhancement of learning by both NREM and REM sleep, indicating a two-stage
    process. Such a model shares assumptions and structures with Buzsáki’s electrophysiological
    model of a hippocampal-neocortical dialogue. Buzsáki posits a transfer of data
    from neocortex to hippocampus in active waking, and consolidation of information
    within the hippocampus along with its transfer back to the neocortex for longer-term
    storage during quiet waking and NREM. Recent experimental and theoretical work
    further indicates that intracortical processing occurs during REM, at which time
    new associative connections might be formed within the neocortex.'

  abstract: When asked to recall their earliest personal memories, most children and
    adults have virtually no recollection of their infancy or early childhood. This
    phenomenon is commonly referred to as childhood amnesia. The fate of our earliest
    memories has puzzled psychologists for over 50 years, particularly in light of
    the importance of early experience in human development. Empirical research has
    shown that infants can both learn and remember very early in development, making
    the ultimate fate of early memories even more mysterious. The theoretical explanation
    of childhood amnesia outlined here relies on age-related changes in encoding,
    retention, and retrieval that occur during infancy and early childhood. Data obtained
    using a host of different memory tasks support the conclusion that quantitative
    changes in these basic memory processes can account for the decline of childhood
    amnesia during the third or fourth year of life.

  volume: '74'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: 'How much can be seen in a single brief exposure? This is an important
    problem because our normal mode of seeing greatly resembles a sequence of brief
    exposures. In this report, the following experiments were conducted to study quantitatively
    the information that becomes available to an observer following a brief exposure.
    Lettered stimuli were chosen because these contain a relatively large amount of
    information per item and because these are the kind of stimuli that have been
    used by most previous investigators. The first two experiments are essentially
    control experiments; they attempt to confirm that immediate-memory for letters
    is independent of the parameters of stimulation, that it is an individual characteristic.
    In the third experiment the number of letters available immediately after the
    extinction of the stimulus is determined by means of a sampling (partial report)
    procedure described. The fourth experiment explores decay of available information
    with time. The fifth experiment examines some exposure parameters. In the sixth
    experiment a technique which fails to demonstrate a large amount of available
    information is investigated. The seventh experiment deals with the role of the
    historically important variable: order of report. It was found that each observer
    was able to report only a limited number of symbols correctly. For exposure durations
    from 15 to 500 msec, the average was slightly over four letters; stimuli having
    four or fewer letters were reported correctly nearly 100\'

  title: Dreaming and Offline Memory Consolidation
  container-title: Current neurology and neuroscience reports
  page: '433'
  volume: '14'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Converging evidence suggests that dreaming is influenced by the consolidation
    of memory during sleep. Following encoding, recently formed memory traces are
    gradually stabilized and reorganized into a more permanent form of long-term storage.
    Sleep provides an optimal neurophysiological state to facilitate this process,
    allowing memory networks to be repeatedly reactivated in the absence of new sensory
    input. The process of memory reactivation and consolidation in the sleeping brain
    appears to influence conscious experience during sleep, contributing to dream
    content recalled on awakening. This article outlines several lines of evidence
    in support of this hypothesis, and responds to some common objections.

  title-short: Neuropeptide S-Mediated Control of Fear Expression and Extinction
  container-title: Neuron
  page: 298-310
  volume: '59'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: A deficient extinction of memory is particularly important in the regime
    of fear, where it limits the beneficial outcomes of treatments of anxiety disorders.
    Fear extinction is thought to involve inhibitory influences of the prefrontal
    cortex on the amygdala, although the detailed synaptic mechanisms remain unknown.
    Here, we report that neuropeptide S (NPS), a recently discovered transmitter of
    ascending brainstem neurons, evokes anxiolytic effects and facilitates extinction
    of conditioned fear responses when administered into the amygdala in mice. An
    NPS receptor antagonist exerts functionally opposing responses, indicating that
    endogenous NPS is involved in anxiety behavior and extinction. Cellularly, NPS
    increases glutamatergic transmission to intercalated GABAergic neurons in the
    amygdala via presynaptic NPS receptors on connected principal neurons. These results
    identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain, a key role of intercalated neurons in
    the amygdala for fear extinction, and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating
    anxiety disorders.

  page: 388-407
  volume: '3'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: In this paper we review the factors alleged to be responsible for the
    creation of inaccurate reports among preschool-aged children, focusing on so-called
    "source misattribution errors." We present the first round of results from an
    ongoing program of research that suggests that source misattributions could be
    a powerful mechanism underlying children${'}$s false beliefs about having experienced
    fictitious events. Preliminary findings from this program of research indicate
    that all children of all ages are equally susceptible to making source misattributions.
    Data from a follow-up wave of data indicate that very young children may be disproportionately
    vulnerable to these kinds of errors when the procedure is changed slightly to
    create mental images more easily. This vulnerability leads younger preschoolers,
    on occasion, to claim that they actually experienced events that they only thought
    about. These preliminary findings are discussed in the context of the ongoing
    debate over the veracity and durability of delayed reports of early memories,
    repressed memories, dissociative states, and the validity risks posed by therapeutic
    techniques that entail repeated visually guided imagery inductions.

    the joint explanatory power of multiple genetic loci, rather than considering
    their effects one at a time. Although this program has made an important contribution
    to understanding the role of genetics in the development of complex behaviors,
    it does not resolve the missing heritability problem.

    In each case, we cite empirical literature to show that the claims are overstated

    claims are misguided.'

  title-short: Pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation
  container-title: The Behavior Analyst
  page: 1-44
  volume: '24'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: A major concern in psychology and education is that rewards decrease intrinsic
    motivation to perform activities. Over the past 30 years, more than 100 experimental
    studies have been conducted on this topic. In 1994, Cameron and Pierce conducted
    a meta-analysis of this literature and concluded that negative effects of reward
    were limited and could be easily prevented in applied settings. A more recent
    meta-analysis of the literature by Deci, Koestner, and Ryan (1999) shows pervasive
    negative effects of reward. The purpose of the present article is to resolve differences
    in previous meta-analytic findings and to provide a meta-analysis of rewards and
    intrinsic motivation that permits tests of competing theoretical explanations.
    Our results suggest that in general, rewards are not harmful to motivation to
    perform a task. Rewards given for low-interest tasks enhance free-choice intrinsic
    motivation. On high-interest tasks, verbal rewards produce positive effects on
    free-choice motivation and self-reported task interest. Negative effects are found
    on high-interest tasks when the rewards are tangible, expected (offered beforehand),
    and loosely tied to level of performance. When rewards are linked to level of
    performance, measures of intrinsic motivation increase or do not differ from a
    nonrewarded control group. Overall, the pattern of results indicates that reward
    contingencies do not have pervasive negative effects on intrinsic motivation.
    Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are addressed.

  title: Quantifying and Addressing Parameter Indeterminacy in the Classical Twin
    Design
  container-title: Twin Research and Human Genetics
  page: 201-213
  volume: '8'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The classical twin design (CTD) is the most common method used to infer
    genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic variation. As has long been acknowledged,
    different combinations of the common environment/assortative mating, and additive,
    dominant, and epistatic genetic effects can lead to the same observed covariation
    between twin pairs, meaning that there is an inherent indeterminacy in parameter
    estimates arising from the CTD. The CTD circumvents this indeterminacy by assuming
    that higher-order epistasis is negligible and that the effects of either dominant
    genetic variation or the common environment are nonexistent. These assumptions,
    however, lead to consistent biases in parameter estimation. The current paper
    quantifies these biases and discusses alternative strategies for dealing with
    parameter indeterminacy in twin designs. One strategy is to model the similarity
    among other relatives in addition to twins (extended twin-family designs), which
    reduces but does not eliminate indeterminacy in parameter estimates. A more general
    strategy, applicable to all twin designs, is to present the parameter indeterminacy
    explicitly, as in a graph. Presenting the space of mathematically equally likely
    parameter values is important, not only because it aids the proper interpretation
    of twin design findings, but also because it keeps behavioral geneticists themselves
    mindful of methodological assumptions that can easily go unexamined.

  title: The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory
  publisher: Oxford University Press
  publisher-place: Oxford, New York
  edition: Second Edition
  abstract: To understand how the brain learns and remembers requires an integration
    of psychological concepts and behavioral methods with mechanisms of synaptic plasticity
    and systems neuroscience. The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, Second Edition,
    provides a synthesis of this interdisciplinary field. Each chapter makes the key
    concepts transparent and accessible to a reader with minimal background in either
    neurobiology or psychology and is extensively illustrated with full-color photographs
    and figures depicting important concepts and experimental data. Like the First
    Edition, the Second Edition is organized into three parts. However, each part
    has been expanded to include new chapters or reorganized to incorporate new findings
    and concepts.Part One introduces the idea that synapses modified by experience
    provide the basis for memory storage. It next describes the long-term potentiation
    methodology used to study how synapses are modified and concepts needed to understand
    the organization of synapses. The remaining chapters are organized around the
    idea that the synaptic changes that support long-term potentiation evolve in four
    overlapping stages referred to as (a) generation, (b) stabilization, (c) consolidation,
    and (d) maintenance. The goal of each chapter is to reveal that each stage depends
    on unique molecular processes and to describe what they are.Part Two builds on
    this foundation to show how molecules and cellular processes that have been identified
    from studies of synaptic plasticity also participate in the making of memories.
    It discusses some of the basic conceptual issues researchers face in trying to
    relate memory to synaptic molecules and describes some of the behavioral and neurobiological
    methods that are used. The chapters describing the processes involved in memory
    formation and consolidation have been extensively modified to provide a more detailed
    account of the molecular events that are engaged to ensure that established memories
    endure. The chapters on memory modulation and the fate of retrieved memories have
    been extensively modified to provide a more in-depth account of the relevant processes.Part
    Three is organized around the multiple memory systems view–that different neural
    systems have evolved to store the content contained in our experience. It features
    discussion of the medial-temporal hippocampal system that supports episodic memory,
    the concept of systems consolidation, and its relationship to Ribot’s law–that
    memories become resistant to disruption as they age. The cortical-striatal system
    and its relationship to what are called behavioral actions and habits is described,
    and the book ends with a discussion of neural systems involved in the acquisition
    and removal of emotional memories. Previous publication dates April 2008

  title: 'Alcohol and Recall: State-Dependent Effects in Man'
  title-short: Alcohol and Recall
  container-title: Science
  page: 1358-1360
  volume: '163'
  issue: '3873'
  abstract: Male vollunteers performed four memory tasks either while sober or lunder
    effects of alcohol. Twenty-four hours later they were tested under the same or
    different conditions. In tasks measuiring recall and interference, learning transfer
    was better when the subject was intoxicated during both sessions than when he
    was intoxicated only during the learning session. In a task measuring recognition,
    transfer was not significantly affected by changing state. Thus, alcohol appears
    to produce "dissociated" or state-dependent effects in man, but not all forms
    of memory are equally sensitive to the phenomenon.

  title: Working Memory Capacity as Executive Attention
  container-title: Current Directions in Psychological Science
  page: 19-23
  volume: '11'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Performance on measures of working memory (WM) capacity predicts performance
    on a wide range of real-world cognitive tasks. I review the idea that WM capacity
    (a) is separable from short-term memory, (b) is an important component of general
    fluid intelligence, and (c) represents a domain-free limitation in ability to
    control attention. Studies show that individual differences in WM capacity are
    reflected in performance on antisaccade, Stroop, and dichotic-listening tasks.
    WM capacity, or executive attention, is most important under conditions in which
    interference leads to retrieval of response tendencies that conflict with the
    current task.

  title: Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 78,308 individuals identifies new
    loci and genes influencing human intelligence
  container-title: Nature Genetics
  page: 1107-1112
  volume: '49'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Intelligence is associated with important economic and health-related
    life outcomes1. Despite intelligence having substantial heritability2 (0.54) and
    a confirmed polygenic nature, initial genetic studies were mostly underpowered3,4,5.
    Here we report a meta-analysis for intelligence of 78,308 individuals. We identify
    336 associated SNPs (METAL P $<$ 5 10-8) in 18 genomic loci, of which 15 are new.
    Around half of the SNPs are located inside a gene, implicating 22 genes, of which
    11 are new findings. Gene-based analyses identified an additional 30 genes (MAGMA
    P $<$ 2.73 10-6), of which all but one had not been implicated previously. We
    show that the identified genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue, and
    pathway analysis indicates the involvement of genes regulating cell development
    (MAGMA competitive P = 3.5 10-6). Despite the well-known difference in twin-based
    heritability2 for intelligence in childhood (0.45) and adulthood (0.80), we show
    substantial genetic correlation (rg = 0.89, LD score regression P = 5.4 10-29).
    These findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of intelligence.

  title: The Interpersonal Core of Personality Pathology
  container-title: Journal of Personality Disorders
  page: 270-295
  volume: '27'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that personality pathology
    is, at its core, fundamentally interpersonal. The authors review the proposed
    DSM-5 Section 3 redefinition of personality pathology involving self and interpersonal
    dysfunction, which they regard as a substantial improvement over the DSM-IV (and
    Section 2) definition. They note similarities between the proposed scheme and
    contemporary interpersonal theory and interpret the Section 3 definition using
    the underlying assumptions and evidence base of the interpersonal paradigm in
    clinical psychology. The authors describe how grounding the proposed Section 3
    definition in interpersonal theory, and in particular a focus on the “interpersonal
    situation,” adds to its theoretical texture, empirical support, and clinical utility.
    They provide a clinical example that demonstrates the ability of contemporary
    interpersonal theory to augment the definition of personality pathology. The authors
    conclude with directions for further research that could clarify the core of personality
    pathology, and how interpersonal theory can inform research aimed at enhancing
    the Section 3 proposal and ultimately justify its migration to Section 2.

  title: 'Neural correlates of consciousness: Progress and problems'
  title-short: Neural correlates of consciousness
  container-title: Nature Reviews Neuroscience
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: 307-321
  volume: '17'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: The neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC) are the minimum neuronal
    mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious experience. It is
    important to distinguish full NCC (the neural substrate supporting experience
    in general, irrespective of its specific content), content-specific NCC (the neural
    substrate supporting a particular content of experience for example, faces, whether
    seen, dreamt or imagined) and background conditions (factors that enable consciousness,
    but do not contribute directly to the content of experience for example, arousal
    systems that ensure adequate excitability of the NCC).The no-report paradigm allows
    the NCC to be distinguished from events or processes such as selective attention,
    memory and response preparation that are associated with, precede or follow conscious
    experience. In such paradigms, trials with explicit reports are included along
    with trials without explicit reports, during which indirect physiological measures
    are used to infer what the participant is perceiving.The best candidates for full
    and content-specific NCC are located in the posterior cerebral cortex, in a temporo-parietal-occipital
    hot zone. The content-specific NCC may be any particular subset of neurons within
    this hot zone that supports specific phenomenological distinctions, such as faces.The
    two most widely used electrophysiological signatures of consciousness gamma range
    oscillations and the P3b event-related potential can be dissociated from conscious
    experiences and are more closely correlated with selective attention and novelty,
    respectively.New electroencephalography- or functional MRI-based variables that
    measure the extent to which neuronal activity is both differentiated and integrated
    across the cortical sheet allow the NCC to be identified more precisely. Moreover,
    a combined transcranial magnetic stimulationelectroencephalography procedure can
    predict the presence or absence of consciousness in healthy people who are awake,
    deeply sleeping or under different types of anaesthesia, and in patients with
    disorders of consciousness, at the single-person level.Extending the NCC derived
    from studies in people who can speak about the presence and quality of consciousness
    to patients with severe brain injuries, fetuses and newborn infants, non-mammalian
    species and intelligent machines is more challenging. For these purposes, it is
    essential to combine experimental studies to identify the NCC with a theoretical
    approach that characterizes in a principled manner what consciousness is and what
    is required of its physical substrate.

  abstract: Waking and sleeping states are privileged periods for distinct mnemonic
    processes. In waking behavior, rapid retrieval of previous experience aids memory-guided
    decision making. In sleep, a gradual series of reactivated associations supports
    consolidation of episodes into memory networks. Synchronized bursts of hippocampal
    place cells during events called sharp-wave ripples communicate associated neural
    patterns across distributed circuits in both waking and sleeping states. Differences
    between sleep and awake sharp-wave ripples, and in particular the accuracy of
    recapitulated experience, highlight their state-dependent roles in memory processes.

  title: Developmental Sequences within and between Concepts
  container-title: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development
  page: 1-84
  volume: '46'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: 'The purpose of this Monograph is to describe and illustrate a new research
    strategy for studying developmental sequences, the rule-assessment approach. The
    approach begins with a distinction between two types of developmental sequences:
    within-concept sequences, involving the series of knowledge states leading to
    mastery of particular concepts; and between-concept sequences, involving the order
    in which different concepts are understood. In its assumptions concerning within-concept
    sequences the approach resembles traditional stage models, but in its assumptions
    concerning between-concept sequences it differs from them. Specifically, like
    the stage approaches, it assumes that children progress through a series of discrete
    knowledge states on their way to full understanding of any particular concept,
    but, unlike them, it does not assume great consistency of reasoning across different
    concepts. The rule-assessment strategy also differs in its reliance on patterns
    of non-verbal responses as the primary index of children’s knowledge. Four experiments
    were performed to illustrate the utility of the rule-assessment approach for studying
    developmental sequences across a variety of concepts and over a wide range of
    ages. In experiments 1 and 2, it was applied to three formal operational proportionality
    tasks: the balance scale, projection of shadows, and probability tasks. In experiments
    3 and 4, it was applied to three concrete operational conservation tasks: conservation
    of liquid quantity, solid quantity, and number. On all six tasks, the approach
    was successful in revealing the contents of children’s knowledge at different
    points in their development. On four of the six, the progression of knowledge
    states proved to be quite different from the traditional Piagetian accounts. The
    rule-assessment approach also allowed comparisons of the structure of children’s
    knowledge across the six tasks. Finally, the data obtained in experiments 3 and
    4 were sufficiently different from any collected previously to suggest a new theory
    of conservation acquisition.'
