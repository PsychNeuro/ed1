# Chapter 7: Thinking and Intelligence

What is *smart*?  This is the fundamental question for this chapter, with many profound personal and societal implications.  Is there just one kind of smart, or are there multiple different forms of intelligence?  How can we reconcile any form of *general* intelligence with everything we've learned up to this point, about how the brain works at a biological level?  The brain is composed of billions of neurons, interconnected by vast networks of synapses, wherein all of our knowledge, and, presumably, intelligence, must lie.  Do "smart" people have more neurons or synapses?  Or, perhaps, fewer synapses?  Are their neurons somehow fundamentally different from other people who measure as less smart according to standard intelligence tests?  And what are those intelligence tests really measuring anyway?  Are they really some kind of "pure" measure of intelligence, or do they just reflect the degree of western-style education (and health and wealth) that a person has?  What does your IQ score really tell us about you as a thinker, and about your prospects for future success in school and the real world?  So many important questions!

If our brains were more like digital computers, these questions would have much simpler answers.  It is relatively easy to measure the power and speed of a computer, and many people tend to think of human intelligence in these terms.  As we discussed in the previous chapter, a computer has discrete parts (the CPU, RAM, and hard drive), and each of these parts can be directly quantified in terms of its capacity and speed.  If you're at all savvy about these things, you can obsess about getting the best value for your money along each of these dimensions, and, generally speaking, the faster the CPU and the more RAM and hard-drive storage, the more you can achieve with your computer.  Computers really do come in obvious degrees of "smartness".

But our brains are nothing like that of a digital computer.  We do *not* have a CPU (at least, not one like that in a standard computer -- more on this in a moment).  Cognition emerges out of the interactions of billions of chattering neurons, which are fundamentally shaped by learning processes over an extended period of time.  As we will explore in the development chapter, we start out with virtually no discernible intelligence (despite how cute and special our parents think we are), and it takes most people a few *years* to even learn how to control your own bowels!  Wow.  The rest of the animal kingdom must think we are complete idiots, which comports with an amusing *Onion* headline to that effect.

Given that we clearly don't start out with much in the way of intelligence, it seems hard to escape the conclusion that intelligence is fundamentally a product of learning (in concert with other developmental / maturational changes).  And this view is also hard to avoid when you think about all those synapses that need to get wired up in just the right way to produce whatever cognitive abilities we end up with.

So are "smart" people just better learners then?  If so, what makes some people better at learning than others?  When we explored this question in the Learning chapter, one of the major conclusions is that learning is driven fundamentally by *motivation*, and all that dopamine and related machinery that gets us up in the morning and ready to pursue our daily goals, etc.

Indeed, we will review various sources of evidence that are consistent with the overall idea that motivational differences play an outsized role in determining measured level of intelligence.  Of course, there are many, many complex factors that shape an individual's trajectory of learning and development, and motivation is itself a multi-faceted thing, so perhaps we aren't explaining too much when we say that motivation plays an important role.

But understanding the major factors shaping intelligence may affect how we think about ourselves, and others, in important ways.  If we view intelligence as a product of learning and motivation, then it is more obviously something malleable.  This is the critical difference between a **fixed mindset** about intelligence, versus a **growth mindset**, as emphasized by *Carol Dweck* and colleagues [@Dweck08], in an increasingly influential body of work.  The growth mindset emphasizes that intelligence is not something that people "have", but rather, something they have to cultivate, and something that grows over time.  Increasingly, schools and teachers are recognizing that motivational factors have a huge impact on educational success, and they are developing innovative ways of motivating students to learn, and making the material more obviously self-relevant.  

Hopefully, you are now motivated to learn more about the history and current state of understanding about the nature of human intelligence, and the thinking processes that underlie it!  We'll start off by exploring the core questions of what "thinking" is, and what kinds of brain mechanisms are particularly important for it.  The conclusion from this may seem to contradict everything that was just said above: maybe we *do* have something like a CPU in our heads after all -- except it is a CPU made out of neurons and brain systems, and it runs on dopamine!  This is an important example of an *emergent* system, like the gears we talked about in the neuroscience chapter: the overall function of a CPU can be supported by various different "substances", just like the gears can be made of many different materials, and yet still function more-or-less the same.

Nevertheless, our neural CPU's have major differences from a computer CPU, and the fact that they are made of neurons does have important implications for how they work.  Indeed, one can understand a lot about the particular strengths and limitations of human cognitive function, in terms of the overall idea that we can do both very neuron-like computation, *and* something that approximates the function of a digital CPU.  We have yet to develop powerful AI (artificial intelligence) systems that capture this unique combination of both forms of computation, and perhaps once we do, we will unlock the real magic of our brains!

After gaining a better understanding of the "mechanics" of intelligence, we'll review the history of thought about the nature of intelligence, and how it has been measured.  Furthermore, we'll examine the data about the real-world implications of IQ test scores, and circle back to these big questions about the relationship between intelligence and motivation.

## The Neural CPU in the Prefrontal Cortex and Basal Ganglia

* Baddeley working memory

* PFC

* active maintenance

* "juggling" of information and bg "gating"

* Turing machines and CPU's: The inherent flexibility of sequential processing: universal computation

* Controlled vs. automatic processing, stroop task


## Differences between Computers and our Neural CPU's

* computers can do prodigious amounts of math & statistics, very quickly

* we kinda suck at that stuff

* but we have neurons!!  those neurons can use *parallel* pattern recognition kinds of strategies to solve prolbems in a "pragmatic" way..

* heuristics and biases..


## Measuring Intelligence and its Implications

* IQ tests

* Multiple intelligences

* real-world implications

* Dweck etc 

* Vogel WM study

* Miyake & Friedman and the genetic basis of IQ: gets stronger over time, just like a learning system.

* important considerations in interpreting genetic results..
