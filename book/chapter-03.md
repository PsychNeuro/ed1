# Chapter 3: Consciousness, Drugs, Sleep, and Dreams

Our entire subjective mental life is essentially synonymous with *consciousness* -- hence its obvious fascination.  As discussed in Chapter 1, psychology has wrestled with the challenge of subjective experience since its inception, and the stigma carried over from the behaviorist dogma against subjective experience still casts a shadow even to this day.  When you start talking about dreams and the legacy of Sigmund Freud in talking about the mysterious workings of the subconscious, modern-day psychological scientists get even more uncomfortable!

As concluded in Chapter 1, we can view subjective and objective as two different perspectives, not two different magical substances, and while each individual has exclusive access to their own subjective perspective, we can all work together to build a consistent objective understanding through the scientific method.  In this chapter, we build on the neuroscience foundation from Chapter 2, to understand more about the **neural correlates of consciousness** *(NCC)* and how we might somehow reconcile the subjective features of conscious experience with some objective facts about the brain.

Then, we delve into the intriguing world of altered states of consciousness induced by drugs and other factors, and then transition into the most universal state of altered consciousness that everyone can relate to: dreams!  We'll see how dreams fit into the rest of what we know about the function of sleep and the different stages of sleep, and how the brain regulates activity between sleep and arousal.

## Neural correlates of consciousness

As the chill cast over the scientific study of consciousness has thawed in the past few decades, a number of prominent theories of consciousness have emerged, most of which share a common core set of premises, even if the proponents may tend to emphasize their differences (this is how science works -- you tend to gain a lot more attention by standing out than fitting in -- *contrast* at work again).  Before we get to these core ideas, we need to be clear about some terminology and ground rules.

First, as discussed in Chapter 1 (which you absolutely need to read before proceeding!), we can productively separate the **hard problem of consciousness** from the **easy problems** [@Chalmers95].  We do this by recognizing that the hard problem, associated with **qualia**, or the fundamental question of "what does it feel like?", is inaccessible to objective science, because it is fundamentally *subjective* -- objective science requires replicable data across many observers, but every subjective experience is an N of 1 [@Nagel74].  Nothing prevents us from speculating about the connections between subjective experience and objective understanding about brains, but it would essentially be impossible to *prove* anything at an objective, scientific level.

The best vehicles for conveying subjective experience are language and art, and as these are exclusively the province of humans, establishing which other types of brains might be conscious, and what their subjective experience might be like, is thus likely impossible.  An important corollary of this is that our understanding of the term *consciousness* is inevitably shaped by our own subjective experience, and it must be acknowledged that there is no such thing as *generic* consciousness -- we can only know about *human* consciousness, and, fundamentally, about our own singular subjective consciousness.  Thus, the popular question, "which other animals, if any, are conscious?", is really asking: "to what extent is the brain of another animal like that of the human, in the ways that might matter for shaping subjective experience?"  While we can speculate about this, we will never really know for sure.

Even if we make an AI that seems "conscious" in every objective way, we can never inhabit its subjective world, and thus can never know for sure what its subjective conscious experience is like.  However, if it starts writing heartfelt poetry, in a way that isn't just regurgitating statistical regularities in human writing (as is the case with the current generation of AI models, e.g., the otherwise impressive GPT-3 model [@BrownMannRyderEtAl20]), we might be able to capture some glimpse of the subjective world of another type of being.

### Features of Consciousness

So what is it *like* to be a human brain?  Even though we all presumably have a strong feeling that we should be able to answer that question, actually doing so in a systematic, satisfying way has proven remarkably challenging.  Early *introspectionists* like Wundt and his student Edward Titchener sought to enumerate and categorize the subjective states of consciousness, but it was precisely the difficulty in doing so that motivated the behaviorists to completely reject the enterprise.  

Modern treatments (e.g., Chalmer's list of the so-called "easy" problems) end up just listing what are essentially the main phenomenology studied by psychologists (and what we'll cover in the rest of this textbook):

* **Perception:** the ability to discriminate and categorize stimuli.

* **Attention:** the ability to focus processing on some subset, to the detriment of others.

* **Motor Behavior:** the ability to generate coordinated actions.

* **Reasoning:** the ability to integrate and organize knowledge.

* **Motivation & Control:** the goal-driven or *intentional* organization of behavior toward certain objectives.

* **Language:** the ability to verbally communicate or report on internal states, ideas, thoughts.

* **Self-awareness and metacognition:** the ability to somehow *access* internal states and be aware of being aware.

* **Wakefulness vs. sleep:** what essentially discriminates these states?  Especially in the case of dreams, this is a widely recognized challenge!

While such lists do a good job of describing what human brains do, and are useful in the medical context, they don't quite seem to capture the essential role of consciousness *per se*.  It seems like you could create a robotic system that could do all these things in a "zombie-like" manner that is essentially akin to sleep-walking: behaving and functioning in complex ways without anything that we would want to really identify as *consciousness* going on.  Indeed, many such robots now exist, and nobody is ready to ascribe true consciousness to them.

One critical interim conclusion here is that *consciousness is not a single, monolithic construct* -- it admits to many degrees or levels, and has many aspects or different facets.  Likewise, existing evidence strongly suggests that no single brain region provides the unique source of consciousness -- it cannot be simply reduced to the effects of one special magical entity (e.g., the pineal gland, as famously hypothesized by Descartes).  Instead, consciousness is almost certainly an emergent phenomenon that depends critically upon neural interactions of some sort, but, just like the simple gears example from Chapter 2, it transcends this neural substrate and cannot be simply reduced to it.

In short, maybe a brain (or AI) that is just capable of basic perception, attention, and motor behavior has some minimal level of subjective conscious-like experience, but likely it is very different in overall character from our full-blown, super awesome human-level consciousness.  

### Recurrent Connectivity as a Major NCC

We can zero in on this key distinction between different *levels* of consciousness within your own subjective experience, to gain some insight into the critical properties of the more full-blown conscious states.  Consider experiences when you were more "zombie-like" versus those where you were "very much aware" and "present" -- what was the critical difference?  For example, when driving down the freeway, thinking of other things in an "absent minded" manner, you may suddenly realize that you haven't been paying any attention to driving, and yet may have done fairly complex maneuvers such as changing lanes or even switching freeways etc.

This difference of being "absent" versus fully "present" seems to depend on the integrated combination of attention and awareness, with a *singular focus* of all the different parts of your brain working together.  Somehow, each part of your brain, and whatever emergent entity we ascribe as the "self", is aware of what the other parts are doing, and all are organized around a common objective.  This is often described as the **unitary** nature of consciousness.

![**Figure 3.1:** Consciousness is associated with robust recurrent processing across wide areas of the neocortex (Lamme, 2006).  (a) With just the initial "feedforward sweep" of neural activity going from primary visual cortex (V1) on up, people generally do not report subjective, conscious awareness. (b) When more time has passed and bidirectional, recurrent connections can drive activity back down through these same visual areas, people are more likely to report conscious awareness.  (c) With even more recurrent processing across more widespread areas of cortex, conscious awareness is strongly felt.  Thus, the degree of recurrent processing provides a good measure of the graded strength of consciousness.](figures/fig_lamme06_recurrent_consc.png){ width=70% }

It is this aspect of consciousness that many neuroscience-based approaches have focused upon, and where there seems to be an emerging consensus, with terms like *global workspace* [@Baars88; @DehaeneNaccache01] and *integrated information* [@Tononi04] used to describe this ability to integrate the disparate parts of the brain together.  Perhaps the most neurally explicit theory along these lines is that **recurrent connectivity** in the brain is  necessary for this integration aspect of consciousness [@Lamme06] (Figure 3.1).  Intriguingly, this form of connectivity, where neurons in different areas have *bidirectional* connections (A excites B, and B also sends excitation back to A), is almost exclusively found in the neocortex.  Perhaps not coincidently, there is considerable evidence that we are also exclusively conscious of neural activity in the cortex -- neural activity in  subcortical areas such as the cerebellum or basal ganglia remains subconscious (as discussed in Chapter 2) [@KochMassiminiBolyEtAl16].

The recurrent activity hypothesis also nicely accounts for **subliminal** stimuli, popularized by the [urban legend](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/subliminal-advertising/) of *subliminal advertising*, where briefly flashed messages in movie theaters are purported to have surprisingly large effects on purchases of popcorn and Coke.  While the advertising part of this is not real (even blaringly *liminal* ads wish they could be so effective), many scientific studies have systematically varied the duration of stimulus presentation, and found that your ability to be consciously aware of the stimulus requires enough time to activate these recurrent circuits [@Lamme06].  And yes, there *are* some detectable effects of briefly flashed subliminal stimuli in these studies, e.g., being slightly faster at processing a second presentation of the same stimulus, known as *repetition priming*, but again nothing that would shape your overt behavior significantly.

In summary, it seems that our most fully conscious states depend on coordinating the firing of neurons across disparate areas of the neocortex around a common focus of attention, over a sufficiently long time period for the neurons to share their individual stories with each other.  This account "resonates" with the idea that our subjective conscious feelings emerge directly out of neural firing in the brain, but also that they are not directly reducible to this neural firing -- consciousness is perhaps the most emergent of all phenomena, requiring coordinated interactions among billions of neurons to generate enough raw emergent magic to give rise to this most amazing phenomenon in the known universe!

### Animal and AI Consciousness

According to the recurrent activity account, we can look at the brains of other animals and determine the extent to which they have the recurrent connectivity necessary to support this form of consciousness, as a way of guessing whether they may share some of this same kind of subjective experience.  Perhaps not surprisingly, our fellow primates are the closest on this score, and it would be difficult to argue that their subjective experience does not also include a similar form of subjective conscious experience.  However, the fact that they lack language and all the amazing things that does for us and our cognitive abilities, will almost certainly make their subjective experience quite different than ours.  Other mammals such as rodents have relatively little neocortex, and almost none of the critical prefrontal cortex that really broadly interconnects and coordinates cortical processing, so maybe they have a correspondingly diminished conscious awareness?

Interestingly, almost all modern neural-network-based AI avoids any significant amount of recurrent connectivity, and the very restricted form of "recurrent networks" that are used are not capable of the kind of broad coordination associated with human consciousness.  This is consistent with the general impression that these models really lack any kind of "self awareness" or introspective capability -- they are just really massive networks of pattern transformers that can imitate the behavior of our brains to some extent, but without that critical recurrent "light" that really makes us tick.

![**Figure 3.2:** Illustration of the concept of *metacognition* and *self awareness* that is central to our subjective sense of consciousness, and can plausibly emerge from massive recurrent connectivity.](figures/fig_metacognition.png){ width=50% }

Figure 3.2 illustrates this key notion of "metacognition" or self awareness that plausibly depends on massive recurrent activation, so that our emergent conscious state can directly access neural activity across the brain.  In later chapters we will revisit this notion of metacognition and its various important roles in human cognition (e.g., in knowing how confident you are about a memory you've retrieved), and we will also discuss the important functional benefits of being able to integrate information across many different brain areas, e.g., for solving challenging novel problems.  Thus, consciousness is not just an interesting sideshow in the theatre of the mind -- it is very likely the main stage upon which our most advanced cognitive abilities depend, and future research on its properties and functions may be critical for making the kinds of advances needed to finally capture human-level intelligence in artificial systems.

## Altered States

Like our consideration of the different levels of consciousness experienced in normal waking, various forms of altered states of consciousness can provide important insights into the overall nature of consciousness.  First, well outside the realm of normal experience, a number of studies of patients with various forms of brain damage have led to the conclusion that no particular part of the brain is essential for consciousness, except that the at least some part of the neocortex must be intact.  Of course, certain brainstem areas are critical for life and for the neocortex to even function properly in the first place, but clearly the neocortex is essential.  However, no specific part of the cortex itself is essential, although higher-level association areas are likely differentially important [@KochMassiminiBolyEtAl16].

A more widely accessible source of altered states can be had by consuming various psychoactive substances, and the challenges and potential for sharing subjective conscious states across the interpersonal void can be experienced by reading literature written by those under the influence of such substances, such as "The Doors of Perception" by Aldous Huxley (namesake of the band *The Doors*), or watching psychedelic movies (e.g., the classic *Altered States*, which gives a good impression of psychologists in the 1970's :)  In general, these altered states can involve changes in the whole gamut of psychological functions, from perceptual hallucinations to heightened emotional states, and disordered cognition.  These effects contrast with the less qualitatively dramatic consequences of drugs like benzodiazepines, which have more "linear" effects on arousal and sedation.

Some research has attempted to connect changes in neurochemistry and receptor function to the nature of the subjective psychoactive experiences, including changes in effective inhibitory and excitatory connectivity that can give rise to characteristic features of visual hallucinations [@BressloffCowanGolubitskyEtAl02].  Thus, again, our subjective conscious states can be understood in terms of direct effects on the underlying neural substrates of the brain, but understanding these effects from the objective outside cannot directly tell us what it feels like subjectively.

### Neuromodulators and Drugs

Given their sociological, psychological and medical importance, we devote some time here to understanding the way that various well-known drugs affect the brain.  As discussed in Chapter 2, there are specific nuclei in the brain stem *reticular activating system* that release *neuromodulators* that have broad overall effects on wide areas of the brain.  Perhaps not surprisingly, these are the major targets of psychoactive drugs, because they have such significant modulatory effects on the brain.  By contrast, *glutamate*, which is the main *neurotransmitter* in the strict sense of transmitting detailed signals from one neuron to the next (in the neocortex and many other areas), is not directly affected by most drugs, and its effects are much more local and content-specific.  GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, can be considered more of a neuromodulator in that it has broader regulatory effects and is directly affected by psychoactive drugs, as we mentioned earlier.  To be clear, this difference between neurotransmitter and neuromodulator is strictly a functional distinction -- they are all just chemicals released by the axons of neurons, but it is useful to distinguish the transmission vs. modulation roles.

Drugs can affect the brain in two opposing ways:

* **Agonists** are drugs that mimic or amplify the effect of a given neuromodulator.  This term is a bit "agonizing" because it doesn't exactly sound like what it means, but you can perhaps remember it better in relation to its opposite (antagonist).  Scientists typically reserve the term *agonist* to more precisely refer to chemicals that specifically bind to the same receptors as the endogenous neuromodulator, but we'll adopt a looser definition that includes anything that has a net "positive" effect on the effect of the neuromodulator.  For example, *Valium* and other *benzodiazepines* are direct GABA agonists by binding to the GABA receptor and enhancing the amount of *Cl-* that enters the cell, whereas *Ritalin* (*Methylphenidate*) enhances dopamine effects by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine after it is released, so it is a kind of agonist but acts more indirectly.  There are many different biochemical mechanisms that can lead to a net agonist effect.

* **Antagonists** are drugs that suppress, inhibit, or otherwise work against a given neuromodulator.  They "antagonize" that poor neuromodulator.  *Curare* poison is a classic competitive antagonist for acetylcholine (ACh) at the synapses of nerve fibers onto muscles, thus acting to paralyze muscles.  It acts by binding directly to the same receptors that ACh normally binds to (and it does so more effectively, i.e., with greater *affinity*), but it does *not* actually open those receptor channels. *Botulinum toxin* (*botox*) is also an overall ACh antagonist, but it works by preventing the release of ACh.

Interestingly, the neuromodulators are biologically ancient chemicals that have very different effects throughout the body, which explains why drugs often have many side-effects.  For example, ACh drives the most basic function of muscle contraction throughout the body, but in the brain it is one of those high-level control knobs affecting attention, arousal, and learning.  Dopamine receptors are also involved in lactation.  Evolution is very pragmatic in re-purposing existing technology.  Furthermore, the major players of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are all chemically very similar *monoamines*, so many drugs affect all of them to varying extents.  Thus, overall, understanding the full effects of any given drug can be very complicated.

* **Caffeine** is a direct antagonist for *adenosine* receptors, which in turn are antagonistic against dopamine, and overall lead to sedation (drowsiness).  Thus, consistent with its widely known and appreciated subjective effects, it directly inhibits drowsiness, and also leads to a net increase in dopamine, producing pleasurable effects and leading to its addictive properties.

* **Nicotine** is an agonist for a type of ACh receptor (the *nicotinic* ACh receptor) that drives the attention and arousal effects of ACh in the cortex.  This is consistent with the stereotypical chain-smoking author or detective using nicotine to enhance their ability to focus and concentrate.

* **Alcohol** (ethanol) has complex effects on neurons, that vary with dose and over time.  It acts as a GABA agonist, increasing levels of inhibition, which accounts for its psychological effects in reducing anxiety, causing sedation, and reducing "behavioral inhibition" as discussed earlier.  It also antagonizes the binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor, which is involved in learning as well see in the Learning chapter.  Both the GABA and NMDA effects combine to impair learning in the hippocampus, leading to memory blackouts.

* **Benzodiazepines** (Valium, Xanax, Midazolam, etc) are widely-used GABA agonists, which, like alcohol, reduce anxiety, cause sedation, and generally turn off the brain to varying extents.  If you've ever had surgery, you've likely had Midazolam, which knocks you out and prevents you from remembering anything.  In low doses, Midazolam has been used in scientific studies to produce a reversible hippocampal amnesia-like condition, due to the heightened sensitivity of the hippocampus to the effects of GABA.

* **Amphetamine** (speed, Adderall) is an agonist for both *norepinephrine (NE)* and dopamine, increasing release and actually reversing the reuptake process so that there is more of these neuromodulators in the synapse.  Both of these neuromodulators affect attention and learning, consistent with the observed behavioral and cognitive effects.  Adderall is used for treating people with ADHD, which is somewhat paradoxical given the "hyperactive" component of this disorder.  However, it is likely that NE acts to keep people actively engaged for a longer time, "locking in" a given set of frontal control signals and preventing the characteristic distractability of ADHD [@Aston-JonesCohen05].

* **Cocaine** is similar overall to amphetamine in both biochemical and psychological effects.  It has a specific inhibitory effect on *dopamine transporter (DAT)* that is responsible for reuptake of dopamine, thus producing an overall agonist effect on dopamine (leaving more in the synapse).  These direct effects on dopamine likely play a critical role in its addictive properties, as it simulates the effects of rewarding outcomes, in a way that circumvents the natural *contrast* mechanisms that discount rewards in proportion to expectations [@Redish04]. 

* **SSRIs** (Prozac et al) affect *serotonin* function by inhibiting the process of reuptake of the neurotransmitter after it has been released (i.e., *serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors*).  This allows serotonin to linger longer, and potentially have a larger overall effect.  However serotonin is so incredibly complex at multiple levels, that nobody really understands exactly what is going on, and we really can't be sure if it is an agonist or an antagonist.  For example, serotonin (and all the other neuromodulators) have negative feedback mechanisms that strongly regulate the amount released, and it is possible that blocking reuptake causes these feedback mechanisms to over-react, thus leading to a net reduction in serotonin release over time.  Furthermore, different serotonin sub-nuclei within the raphe have contradictory effects, with some promoting positive emotional states and others having the opposite effects.

* **Psychedelics** (LSD, psilocybin, peyote, etc) all have primary effects on the serotonin system, which, among its many talents, is important for regulating sleep.  The simplest explanation for the effects of these substances is that they effectively produce a waking dream state -- dreams have similar characteristics to psychedelic experiences in terms of heightened emotional states and disorganized cognition driven by loose associative connections instead of the more controlled, willful, goal-directed states that characterize waking cognition.  The reasons for these effects can be directly connected to the effects of serotonin on different brain areas, as we discuss in the next section.

* **Cannabis** (Marijuana) is a unique case where the drug activates receptors and associated endogenous neurotransmitter systems that were previously unknown, and have only relatively recently been discovered as a direct result of studying the effects of the drug.  Thus, the receptors and endogenous neurotransmitters are known as *cannabinoid* receptors and *endocannabinoids*, and now that we have the tools to identify these things, they turn out to be found all over the body, like all the other more well-known neuromodulatory systems.  However, unlike these other systems, the reason we never knew of these cannabinoid systems before is that they don't have a central nucleus that releases them -- instead they are produced locally in cell membranes, and have a very localized signaling role, by sending messages *backward* across the synapse (i.e., from dendrite back to axon, instead of the usual other way around).  The detailed function of these systems is still relatively unknown, and represents an exciting frontier in current research, well-timed with the recent legalization of this interesting substance in a number of different US states and other countries.

* **Narcotics** (heroin, morphine, fentanyl, opiates) are agonists for the endogenous opioid system, involved in regulating the neural response to pain stimuli.  Opioid receptors are found in the amygdala, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and thalamus, and this explains the strong emotional, euphoric effects of these drugs.  These substances are widely believed to be the most addictive of all drugs.

In summary, these drugs are jacking right into those global control knobs in the brain, and provide a critical window into understanding how our brains function normally: your endogenous states of arousal, excitement, sedation, etc are all controlling these very same knobs.  Some of these psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine are very widely used (and abused), and there have been increasingly urgent discussions about the ethics of performance-enhancing drug use in schools, which is on the rise.  To what extent is this like doping in sports, or should we instead consider it more like using a calculator or a computer: something that augments our native biological abilities to the general betterment of society, etc?  What is your opinion?

## Sleep and Dreams

![**Figure 3.3:** The four stages of sleep and their timecourse over a typical night.  Deeper stages are characterized by slower brain waves (slow wave sleep), and brain waves during REM are similar to waking.  Progressively less deep sleep and progressively more REM sleep occur over the course of a night.](figures/fig_sleep_stages.jpg){ width=75% }

First, considerable research has identified four characteristic stages of sleep that unfold over a roughly 90 minute cycle progressively through the night (Figure 3.3).

![**Figure 3.4:** The frontal cortex goes deeply to sleep when you're dreaming, while the amygdala and hippocampus are highly active.  This explains why your dreams are so incoherent and disorganized, and it is impossible to ever catch an airplane or show up for a test on time, etc.  Also, dreams are emotionally charged and incorporate recent memories, thanks to the amygdala and hippocampus.](figures/fig_sleep_pfc_inact_amyg_act.png){ width=75% }


* basic stages of sleep / arousal and critical roles of brainstem systems and thalamus

* insomnia and the interdependence of frontal cortex with brainstem neuromodulatory systems

* neural basis of input consciousness in terms of bidirectional interactions: consciousness is a reflection of this mutual interdependence and interaction among neurons.  Neocortex is unique in having bidirectional excitatory connections, which come at cost of epilepsy.
