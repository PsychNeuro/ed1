# Chapter 3: Consciousness, Sleep, Arousal and Emotion

Intro

## Why are we only conscious of the cortex?

![Fig 3-1: Consciousness is associated with robust recurrent processing across wide areas of the neocortex (Lamme, 2006).](figures/fig_lamme06_recurrent_consc.png){ width=100% }

todo: metacognition figure too.


## Sleep

![Fig 3-2: The four stages of sleep and their timecourse over a typical night.  Deeper stages are characterized by slower brain waves (slow wave sleep), and brain waves during REM are similar to waking.  Progressively less deep sleep and progressively more REM sleep occur over the course of a night.](figures/fig_sleep_stages.jpg){ width=75% }


![Fig 3-3: The frontal cortex goes deeply to sleep when you're dreaming, while the amygdala and hippocampus are highly active.  This explains why your dreams are so incoherent and disorganized, and it is impossible to ever catch an airplane or show up for a test on time, etc.  Also, dreams are emotionally charged and incorporate recent memories, thanks to the amygdala and hippocampus.](figures/fig_sleep_pfc_inact_amyg_act.png){ width=75% }


* basic stages of sleep / arousal and critical roles of brainstem systems and thalamus

* insomnia and the interdependence of frontal cortex with brainstem neuromodulatory systems

* neural basis of input consciousness in terms of bidirectional interactions: consciousness is a reflection of this mutual interdependence and interaction among neurons.  Neocortex is unique in having bidirectional excitatory connections, which come at cost of epilepsy.


## Emotion and Arousal

* extensive interconnected networks of areas devoted to emotion and arousal, at all levels of the brain.  thus, from the modern perspective, emotion is as much of an emergent, interactive process as anything else in the brain.  However, historically, people took rather extreme and somewhat strange and hard-to-understand perspectives. James-lange / Cannon-Baird etc.

* is emotion really what makes humans unique?  hollywood clearly thinks so: evil robotic non-emotional beings...  part of this is that emotion is what keeps us from harming each other: psychopaths lack that basic emotional connection.  So, from a survival perspective, we really depend on everyone sharing these protective emotional responses, and anything that doesn't is immediately scary and foriegn.  

* circumplex model.
