# Chapter 9: Evolution, Genetics, and Development

Having now explored the full scope of human cognition, from perception to the highest levels of intelligent reasoning, we now circle back and consider the incredibly fascinating and challenging question of *origins* -- where does everything a mature adult can do come from in the first place?  In the learning chapter, we touched a bit on this question, arguing that the genetic code could not possibly contain enough information to directly specify the synaptic connection strengths of even a small fraction of the billions of cortical neurons that support all of our cognitive functions.  Thus, learning must play a critical role.  And yet, we don't yet have fully satisfying, widely-accepted accounts of how this learning unfolds, and how the considerable genetic shaping of the basic organization and wiring of the brain interacts with these learning processes to determine how we develop.

Thus, development remains more of a mystery than most of the other topics that we cover.  But certainly much is known about the *phenomenology* of development -- how in fact we do develop over time, and when our different capacities begin to emerge.  Furthermore, we also know a great deal about genetics and how the blueprints of life are encoded in our genes, and understanding the nature of these mechanisms is essential for having a more complete picture of how biology can shape and constrain our developmental processes.  We begin our exploration of these issues at the natural beginning: with the process of evolution -- the origin of everything!

## Evolution

Evolution is an absurd theory on the face of it.  How is it even remotely possible that a beast such as a fish could *ever* give birth to something that was *not* a fish?  And even if it did, how could that freak ever mate with anything else to propagate its non-fishiness?  Two freaky non-fish emerging at the same time, in close enough proximity to propagate this new species?  It just doesn't add up.  Presumably everyone has heard the basic principle of *survival (and reproduction) of the fittest* as the primary engine of __adaptation__ in evolution, but it seems that this alone does not really explain things.  Undoubtedly, the sheer implausibility of the ideas at this basic level contributes at least something to the continued reluctance that people have toward this theory.

There are several things we can work through to help resolve some of these conundrums.  First, we need a clear overall framework for thinking about biology, and what we are actually made of -- fortunately, LEGO provides a really nice, familiar analogy.  Second, we need to think more carefully about the actual nature of evolutionary change: it is very incremental, and yet somehow can produce large changes over time -- reconciling those two points is difficult within our limited scope of experience.  Here, computational models can be immensely useful in providing the missing "long timeframe" perspective, by simulating many generations of evolution within a few minutes of human time.  Furthermore, a few basic principles can go a long way toward resolving the basic problems stated above.

![Fig 9-1: Which picture shows cells from a human and which from a frog?  At the cellular level, all animals are essentially identical, built from the same building blocks -- just like you can build so many different things using the same set of LEGO blocks.  Understanding this makes it easier to see how different bodily forms can emerge through evolution.](figures/fig_human_vs_frog_cells.png){ width=60% }

![Fig 9-2: Biology is remarkably like LEGO: the same small set of basic building blocks can be recombined to produce many different animals.  This continuity across all animals makes it clearer how evolution can work: you just need to tweak the instructions a bit and you can end up with entirely different animals, as in this 3-in-1 kit that uses the same parts, with different instructions, to make very different animals.  In biology, genes are the instruction set, and these instructions are constantly subject to random changes, producing novel "experiments of nature". ](figures/fig_lego_animals.png){ width=60% }

When you think of the manifold differences between a fish and a human being, evolution seems impossible.  However, these differences disappear when you zoom in to the cellular level, where it immediately becomes clear that all animals are made from the same basic building blocks (Figure 9-1).  This is really the level at which evolution is operating -- the macroscopic forms of organisms are more of an emergent result of cellular and sub-cellular processes unfolding over the developmental process, just like our cognition is an emergent product of our neurons interacting in complex ways.  

The easiest way to understand this is in terms of the more familiar process of building different things out of LEGO blocks (Figure 9-2).  A very small set of basic building blocks can be used to make an essentially infinite number of different objects.  Furthermore, the developmental process is akin to the process of following the step-by-step instructions to assemble the final product.  As you may have experienced, small random errors at an early stage can have major implications later.  Likewise in biology, relatively small changes in the developmental process can lead to major changes in the overall shape and function of the organism.  To make a bigger brain, you just have to tweak the process that controls how long nerve cells divide and proliferate, in the same way you would just keep adding blocks to a LEGO wall to make it bigger.  Thus, major macroscopic changes can emerge from relatively minor changes in the program.

In biology, the genetic code is the equivalent of the LEGO instruction booklet, and we'll see below that it has many interesting properties consistent with the idea that this process of controlling the timing and coordination of the building process is where much of the action has taken place over the course of evolution.

Perhaps it is now clearer how very different-looking organisms can emerge from relatively minor tweaks to the genetic code, and how in fact a fish very likely could produce some rather different offspring even in a single generation.  But the other puzzles remain: how could that weird offspring itself procreate, and lead to the origin of new species, and more complex, sophisticated biological machinery?  This is really the hard problem of evolution that Darwin tackled, and later theorists such as *Stephen J. Gould* wrestled with.  

One key idea here is that gradual, continual change from one generation to the next is much easier to understand than some kind of entirely new beast emerging whole within a single generation -- even though random changes in the genetic code can produce such things, they indeed aren't likely to have survived and procreated.  But how does gradual change ever lead to something dramatically different ever emerging?  We can consider two cases: emergence of air breathing from a fish, and the emergence of flying birds from dinosaurs.

In the case of the air breathing, one could easily imagine that there was some gradual advantage to being able to gulp some extra oxygen from the surface of the water -- such fish would have more energy, and this would be especially important if the water ended up being less oxygenated, e.g., as happens in algae blooms.  Also, there is plenty of evidence that proto-lungs emerged for various other digestive and boyancy-control functions.  Then, as this ability was selected for over time, more and more oxygen could be processed, until at some point, such animals could actually survive by breathing air.  If they happened to get trapped on land, as often happens during tidal cycles, then you end up with all the right ingredients for one of the most dramatic events in evolutionary history.  Of course, we don't know how it actually happened for sure, but by thinking about how gradual *quantitative* processes can eventually turn into a major *qualitative* changes, at least it may seem more plausible.

In the case of bird feathers and flight, we now know that many dinosaurs had feathers, presumably for temperature regulation.  Thus, like the oxygen example, something can be adaptive in one way, before it becomes "co-opted" for something else entirely -- Gould referred to this as an **exaptation**, while Darwin referred to it as *preadaptation* (which sounded a bit too "prescient" for Gould).  Thus, the dinosaurs that climbed trees, and had feathers for keeping cool, eventually discovered that they could glide their way to safety using these same feathers, and a whole new adaptive function and corresponding gradual selection pressure emerged, to make better and better wings.

Putting all this together, this initially crazy-sounding idea perhaps makes more sense.  It just takes a lot of time and a lot of random accidents and amazing stories of survival -- those challenges are the "desirable difficulties" of evolution that have driven survival of the fittest to select some radical new innovations.  It took many such apocalypses to get us where we are today, and it is thoroughly mind-blowing to try to grasp this idea that we are just the latest spawn in a "great chain of being" stretching back billions of years.  But look again at Figure 9-1: at this level, not that much has really changed in all those years!

To really see evolution happening in "real time" that we can actually comprehend, people have developed computer simulations of evolution, and it definitely works!  Indeed, there is a quote that neural network algorithms (modeled on the functioning of the brain) are the second best solution to any complex problem, and the third best solution is a **genetic algorithm**, which is the general computer-science version of evolution.  Randomly searching a complex, high-dimensional space, and combining the features of the best-functioning exemplars works really well for finding novel, previously-unimagined solutions to complex problems.

*Jeff Clune* and colleagues have developed particularly compelling, bio-mimetic simulations of the evolution of organisms, often with very funny but functional properties: [YouTube video of Evolving Soft Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9ptOeByLA4) -- this is really a must-see video! 


## Genetics

![Fig 9-3: Molecular structure of DNA, which has an alphabet of only *4* different letters: G, C, T, A.  They are paired with each-other as shown, but any given strand could have any one of these different letters in any order.](figures/fig_dna.png){ width=40% }

As we mentioned above, the biological equivalent of the LEGO instruction booklet is the *genome* -- the collection of genes that determine how everything in our bodies (and every other living organism) is built.  It is amazing how much progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of biology since the structure of DNA was discovered in the early 1950's, and published in 1953 by *James Watson* and *Francis Crick* (who later became somewhat of a neuroscientist, confirming that the brain is the most fascinating thing in the universe, and the "last refuge of scoundrels").  And it is also amazing that this all happened so recently -- we are the first few generations of beings that now know (more or less) how that great chain of life actually works.

At its base, the genetic program is remarkably simple: there are only *4* different letters in the language of life: G, C, T, A, which are always paired GC and TA (Figure 9-3).  These 4 **base pairs** don't do much by themselves -- it takes 3 of them in sequence to determine a corresponding __amino acid__ (of which there are 20 different varieties coded in the DNA).  Interestingly one of these amino acids is *Glutamic acid*, which is the basis of both the ubiquitous excitatory neuotransmitter glutamate, and MSG, and another is *Tyrosine*, which is the direct chemical precursor of the major neuromodulators dopamine, epinepherine, and norepinepherine.  Thus, like the ions sodium and chloride, the key ingredients that make the brain tick are really basic and universal in biology, coded directly by just 3 base pairs in our DNA.

The more complex building blocks in biology are composed from sequences or polymers of these amino acids, i.e., __proteins__.  These are the LEGO blocks of the body, and our DNA directly codes for how to build these blocks via those sequences of 3 base pairs.  However, only a tiny fraction (about 1.5%) of our total DNA actually codes for these proteins, of which there are about 20,000 different types.  Proteins come in various lengths, from a few hundred up to 20,000 amino acids in size.  However, the *genes* that code for these proteins are typically *much* longer than the minimal number required to code for the literal amino acid sequence.

Thus, there is quite a gap between the very concrete, well-understood level of DNA, amino acids, and proteins, and the rather fuzzier notion of __genes__.  Genes are defined functionally as units of **heredity** -- the basic elements that we can inherit from our parents, and the simple idea that each gene codes for a different protein holds in some cases, but only a tiny minority.  Again, LEGO is incredibly helpful in understanding why this might be the case.  When you're building a lego kit, the vast majority of the information in the instruction booklet concerns *where* and *when* to place the bricks, with only a relatively tiny bit of information concerning the different bricks that are available to build with.  For example, there may be around 100-200 different types of bricks in a typical reasonably complex LEGO kit, but the amount of information it takes to specify exactly where to place those bricks is much greater (and somewhat difficult to quantify, given its visual nature).

Thus, although the remaining 98% of the human genome that does not code for proteins was originally characterized as "junk DNA", it is highly likely that most of it is serving a vital function akin to the bulk of the LEGO instruction booklet: determining when and where to build all those proteins.  For example, we know that much of the extra "junk" within a given protein-coding gene plays a *regulatory* role, shaping the complex process that actually *transcribes* the DNA sequence into a corresponding amino acid sequence to make up the proteins.  Perhaps we will ultimately find the equivalent of a computer programming language embedded in all this regulatory DNA, complete with `if-then` rules and `for` loops, etc.  As with the LEGO instruction booklet, most of the power and functionality in a computer program comes from these kinds of control structures, rather than the raw "proteins" (e.g., numbers, characters or other data) that is being manipulated.


### Heritability and Individual Differences

Aside from the pure intellectual fascination of understanding the amazing genetic machinery that makes us tick, the practical relevance to psychology and neuroscience comes in understanding how our genetic information is inherited from our parents, and how much of our overall brain function it ends up contributing.  This is the domain of **behavioral genetics**, which traditionally was performed by comparing __identical (monozygotic)__ versus **fraternal (dizygotic)** twins, and is now also able to leverage the advances in *molecular genetics* to directly compare genetic material across people.

Monozygotic twins started out from the same **zygote** (fertilized egg cell), and they thus share 100% of their DNA, whereas dizygotic twins came from two separate egg cells, and have the same genetic similarity on average as any siblings born from the same parents (i.e., 50%).  The exact process by which this 50% genetic similarity arises is surprisingly complex.  Likely everyone remembers hearing about __meiosis__ and __mitosis__ from high-school biology, but you probably don't remember all the crazy details.  Basically, there are two critical levels of genetic shuffling  responsible for producing the essential randomness that powers evolution.

Here's the brief summary: first, each *gamete* (germ cell -- egg or sperm) undergoes mitosis, and this is where *your own genetic material* that you inherited from *your* parents is first shuffled.  This shuffling process occurs as your two copies of each **chromosome** (there are 23 distinct chromosomes, which are large collections of DNA) are split apart, such that each gamete only has *one* copy of each chromosome (i.e., it is "haploid", compared to the normal "diploid" with 2 copies).  Thus, a major source of genetic randomness occurs independently in each parent, essentially re-shuffling the deck that each inherited from their parents.  Then, after sexual intercourse, the fertilization of the egg by the sperm results again in two copies of each chromosome, one from each gamete.  But these two copies don't just line up next to each other -- they also engage in a further reshuffling across the two chromosomes!

After all that, you are now left with the diploid double-copies of each chromosome, which is then the basis of all this **dominant** vs. __rescessive__ traits business.  If both resulting copies of a given gene across the two chromosomes are the same, then there is nothing further of interest to discuss -- that gene will do whatever it does, in the same way, all the time.  This is actually the default case: over 99% of our genes are identical across all people, and thus across your two parents.  However, for the roughly 0.6% of our genes that do differ across people, you may end up with a different version of that gene in each of your different chromosomes.  These different versions are called **alleles**, and they are entire focus of interest in behavioral genetics and the study of heritability more generally.  Some versions of a given gene are more likely to be transcribed and **expressed**, and this is what is meant by *dominant* vs. *recessive* (and like most things, it is a continuum, not a dichotomy).  Thus, only if you end up having both copies of a gene in the recessive (non-dominant) form, will that recessive version actually do its thing.  Otherwise, it generally (but not absolutely) doesn't matter that much.

This is the reason we (still) have genetic disorders at any significant rate in the population.  Any allele (genetic variant) that is dominant *and* produces bad effects, is quickly driven out of the population through natural selection -- people with that gene version don't tend to survive and reproduce.  However, a recessive gene can fly under the radar and persist in the population, because the odds of two people having the *same* recessive gene variant is really quite low on average (only 0.6% of genes vary at all, and most recessive alleles are relatively rare on top of that).  Except, of course, if they are siblings or otherwise closely related, which is why incest is generally frowned upon.

Now we can actually talk about how behavioral genetics works.  Basically, it amounts to comparing the genetic similarity of people against their **phenotypic** similarity, where the **phenotype** is just a complex word for the thing you are actually interested in, such as IQ, height, eye color, etc.  For a very small set of phenotypes, your genes essentially determine 100% of how you'll end up.  For example, there are specific genes that cause Huntington's disease, and cystic fibrosis.  But for almost everything else, the relationship between genetic differences and phenotypic differences is much more complex, and actually determining how much can be attributed to genes is surprisingly challenging.

Let's take the case of IQ.  As we discussed in the chapter on intelligence, there is ample evidence that your IQ is a function of learning, motivation, and the wealth and general __socio-economic status (SES)__ of your parents.  Thus, any dependence on genes is likely to be at least somewhat indirect.  But how can we measure it?  The simplest way would be to compare the IQ's of identical (monozygotic) versus fraternal (dizygotic) twins, and somehow use their known overall genetic similarity differences to compute how much of their measured IQ differences can be accounted for by those known genetic factors.  But what about the fact that everyone is being raised in the same house in this case, by the same parents?  Ideally, you would like to include twins reared apart, in different homes, but these are quite rare.  Fortunately, you can use regular siblings reared apart too, as a way to estimate the influence of the environment.

The net result of all these calculations is something called **heritability** (typically denoted by the letter *h*), and it is a measure of the amount of the overall *variance* in the phenotype (e.g., IQ score) across individuals that can be attributed to the differential genetic variance across these individuals.  An *h* value of 1 means that all of the phenotypic variance is attributable to genetic variance, and a value of 0 means that none of it is.  Typically, the *h* value for IQ is in the .6 range, meaning that more than half of the variance in measured IQ can be attributed to genetic variance.

TODO: need to emphasize the need to *contrast* with the environment above.

However, there several major problems with this approach.

* important considerations in interpreting genetic results: percent of variance -- need a good simple real-world example.  how much pie you can eat?  make the pie smaller, you can now eat a larger % of the pie!
