# Chapter 9: Personality and Social Psychology

One of the most prominent biologically-grounded theories for what makes human beings so successful as a species centers on our social orientation and the evolutionary forces that have shaped us to become so strongly dependent on others for our basic survival.  Specifically, in comparing human infants with our closest primate relatives, Michael Tomasello concluded that people have an innate desire to *share* (experiences, emotions, information, resources) that is notably stronger than in chimpanzees or other great apes [@Tomasello01].  This desire to share forms the foundation of *culture*, and without everything that we get from our culture, we are not much different than any other ape.  Culture (social transmission of knowledge) gives us *everything*: knowledge of which foods to eat and which to avoid, how to prepare them to maximize energy content (i.e., how to start a fire and grill stuff), how to farm, how to make tools, from primitive stone through all of the major "ages" of human history, up to now, the "information age", where it seems that every living being spends all their time sharing every last detail of their lives over the internet!

The social forces of *identity* and *belonging* rise to a crescendo through adolescence, driving so many seemingly irrational behaviors -- and by the time they become parents, somehow people forget what this time was like, and expect their kids to just be "normal", like they were a few years earlier.  This is the time when the mysterious evolutionary forces wielded by *hormones* turn our attention so strongly outward, to shape so fatefully our future roles in the larger world.  Much of literature and film remains obsessed with this *coming of age* dynamic which lies at the core of the *hero's journey*, recognized by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 book [@Campbell49] as the underlying plot structure of many stories from ancient mythology through to the modern day.

The plot starts with the relative comfort and security of childhood, which is disturbed by some kind of threat or call to adventure.  This is the impetus to leave the nest, which is initially refused, but stronger forces (often supernatural) conspire to force a crossing of the point of no return -- out into the mysterious wider world, where previously unknown strengths and abilities are discovered, and a newfound self understanding begins to emerge, often through social isolation.  In many cultures, this is ritualized in various *rites of passage* or *initiations* (e.g., bar / bat mitzvah; tattooing in Samoa) marking the transition to adulthood, and accompanied by an explicit process of separation, followed by various tests and challenges.  This deep-seated initiation schema is also employed to strong effect in cults, which likewise require rejection of the previous "normal" life, and often significant physical, painful acts that test and demonstrate their convictions.

One of the major hero's journey plot points involves learning about romantic love, and another, especially for the male-dominated version of the story, involves the oedipal conquest of some kind of dominant father figure, which represents the ultimate test and door to true freedom and self realization.  There's also a key role for various guides and teachers in helping the hero along (yay teachers!)  Finally, the victorious hero returns back to the homeland, bringing some kind of critical benefit (e.g., saving the world from ultimate destruction).  The plot of the Star Wars saga (episodes 4-6) illustrates this journey perfectly, where the hapless Luke is wrest from his family and must find his inner jedi across a series of tests, ultimately conquering his actual father in the ultimate battle to save the world from certain destruction.

The power and pervasiveness of this hero's journey *monomyth* speaks to the depth of social forces in shaping our identities, goals, and understanding of the world around us.  And from a more practical, functional perspective, the fundamentally *open-ended* nature of these social forces is critical for driving the open-ended, adaptive nature of human behavior and cognition.  Given the importance of motivation in driving learning and intelligence, social forces provide a strong biologically-grounded motivational system that continuously changes as function of the ever-changing culture that surrounds us.  Food and drink just do not have that same open-ended character, and it is striking that the spontaneous language production of apes who have been taught sign language is just endless blabbering about these basic necessities of life. 

In other words, other apes never ascend beyond the bottom level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Figure 5.9), and this hierarchy is really the ladder that has enabled us to climb our way up into our current "enlightened" state of being.  The human child is strongly driven by love and belonging in the family context, and adolescence is all about moving to the next level up, of esteem, confidence, achievement, and respect from (and of) others.  Once you become a jedi master, you ascend to the highest level of self-actualization.

Despite the dominance of social forces in shaping us, or perhaps because of it, people have a strong tendency to underestimate and outright reject the strength of these forces, especially in some cultures.  For example, in the strongly individualistic western cultures such as the USA, many people cultivate the image of the individual as strongly self-sufficient, and those who depend on society as weak and inferior.  However, such people strongly underestimate how significantly their views are shaped by various social influences, and how completely their lives depend on the actions and good will of others.  Our general fascination with castaways likely stems from this basic conflict and longing for individual freedom in the face of all this social pressure!

This fundamental conflict between the individual and social forces is one of the major topics of social psychology, for example in exploring how people explain the behavior of self an others, known as *attribution* theory.  For example, the *fundamental attribution error* [@Ross77] is the tendency for people to over-emphasize *dispositional* attributes and under-emphasize *situational* factors, consistent with the individualistic, western-style mindset.

This conflict is also at the center of personality psychology, which has wrestled with the fundamental question of the extent to which there are strong, stable, coherent dispositional traits driving people's behavior across a range of different situations, which is the operational definition of *personality traits*.  Early challenges to personality psychology argued that most of behavior was driven by situational factors [@Mischel68], but there is now a strong consensus around the *big five* personality factors that have been replicated across many studies.  Most of these factors concern the interaction between the individual and their social environment, suggesting again the importance of social forces in shaping who we are.

In short, social and personality psychology as a field is focused on this critical interface between the individual and the broader social environment, and, in part due to practical limitations, empirical studies often only involve a single individual, or a dyad (one of whom is often a *confederate* in the experiment, acting out a prescribed role).  Considerable theorizing in the field is centered around the construct of the *self*: what kind of internal model do we have of ourselves, how does this self-concept change as a result of different kinds of social interactions, and how does it shape our own behavior?  Despite this seemingly individual-focused perspective, there is a basic assumption that our self-understanding emerges out of our social interactions with others, and that our sense of self would be greatly diminished if we lived alone on a deserted island.

We begin our discussion by connecting some of the core ideas in social and personality psychology with the central themes developed in the earlier chapters, showing how all three of the C's (compression, contrast, and control) play leading roles here.  

## The Subjective and Objective Self

Perhaps to an even greater degree than in other domains of psychology, social and personality psychology wrestles directly with the challenges of creating a science out of the subjective, first-person perspective.  The notion of the *self* is, obviously, grounded inevitably in our own subjective experiences, and much of the data collected is in the form of **self-report** about the nature of these subjective experiences.  Considerable effort has been made to cross-validate these self-report measures with other more objective measures, and although systematic biases are likely to exist, and there is a considerable amount of noise in any of these measures, to a remarkable extent people are willing to share even socially undesirable features of themselves with inquiring scientists [@Paulhus91; @PodsakoffMacKenzieJeong-YeonLeeEtAl03; @Chan09].

More recently, social psychologists have developed a number of clever techniques that bypass explicit self reports and tap more directly into *implicit* internal representations [@GreenwaldMcGheeSchwartz98] that are less likely to be contaminated by self-report biases.  These techniques have revealed the pervasive and insidous nature of stereotypes in ways that other techniques had not [@NosekSmythHansenEtAl07].

In contrast with the more subjectively focused notions of the self, *personality* has come to be operationalized and understood more from the objective, outside perspective.  Specifically, the *big-five* personality factors focus on patterns of overt *behavior*, and there is a strong concern for validating these measures between self-report and the reports of other people (friends, relatives), and across different cultures [@McCraeCostaMartinEtAl04; @McCraeCosta97].  Furthermore, the central reliance on the empirical, statistical technique of factor analysis, instead of a more theoretically-driven approach, results in a more objectively-focused framework.

## The Predictive Self-Model

To ground our understanding of the *self* in terms of the neural mechanisms of learning, motivation, and perception developed in the previous chapters, we can view the self as a high-level internal mental model that emerges as a result of predictive, error-driven learning in order to **compress** and simplify our subjective experiences.  We experience a continuous stream of actions, emotions, motivations, sensations, and by integrating these into a coherent overall predictive model, the **self-model**, we can achieve a simpler high-level encoding of all of these diverse states.

Thus, the self is just like any other stable factor that we perceive in the world (like size, color, shape, etc) -- to the extent that it provides a simpler, more compressed way of understanding (and predicting) what we experience, we perceive this stable construct instead of a more jumbled collection of stimuli.  In other words, we have *self-constancy* in the same way that we have size-constancy and all the other constancies as discussed in the perception chapter.

A compelling demonstration for how our subjective sense of self could emerge from an internal model that is driven by predicting diverse multi-modal sensory inputs is provided by the **rubber hand illusion** [@BotvinickCohen98]. In this experiment, people (myself included -- I was a participant!) experienced a striking subjective sensation that a rubber hand was their own hand, due to the convergence of visual and somatosensory sensations associated with synchronous brushing of the real hand and the rubber hand.  In other words, you see the rubber hand being brushed, and feel at precisely the same moment your own hand being brushed, and the simplest explanation for your brain is that you are looking at your own hand being brushed.  Like the illusions you experienced in the perception chapter, the power of this demonstration is in the immediate subjective experience of self-ness attributed to the obviously rubber hand -- it is truly freaky, and unfortunate that we cannot easily reproduce it in this book.

These basic learning forces that create an internal self-model could also then be responsible for producing the behavior of **mirror neurons**, which appear to encode the intentions of motor actions produced by either the self or someone else that you are observing [@IacoboniWoodsRizzolatti99; @IacoboniDapretto06].  In other words, we learn the self-model to provide a compressed, predictive representation of everything that we experience, but once it has been learned, it can then become activated by other partial sensory inputs, i.e., visual input of another person's action, without all of the other subjective somatosensory stimuli associated with our own actions.

Critically, this ability to map the actions of others into our own internal self-model then enables us to also learn more directly from the experiences and behaviors of others -- i.e., through **imitation** and more general forms of *vicarious*, *observational* learning, as we discussed in Chapter 5.  To reiterate from that discussion, it is most likely that the capacity for imitation depends on extensive sensory-motor learning, and emerges progressively along with this learning over a protracted period of development [@Jones09a; @Paulus14].  This emerging self-model can then provide the foundation upon which many other social processes take place, by enabling us to perform the critical function of translating our third-person perspective on the behaviors of others into our own first-person subjective understanding for *why* other people might behave in the way they do (i.e., **empathy** and **theory-of-mind**, as we discuss below).

This neuroscience-based framework converges nicely with some of the dominant theoretical perspectives developed within the field of social psychology, particularly the **social learning theory** developed by Albert Bandura [@Bandura77a], which has had a tremendous impact on many fields outside of psychology as well, especially education and business.  The core elements of this theory are that people can learn by observing the behaviors of others, and the outcomes that others experience (i.e., **vicarious reinforcement**).  Another crucial element of this framework is that people are not merely passive experiencers of reward and punishment, but rather play an active role in shaping their own environment and their own sense of **self efficacy** [@Bandura77].  This is consistent with the central role of **control** and the nature of our motivational systems, as discussed in Chapter 5.

In the following sections, we discuss a number of widely-studied phenomena and theories that inform our understanding of how this self-model might function.

## Attributions

**Attribution theory** has been highly impactful in social psychology -- it directly concerns the explicit judgments ("attributions") that people make about motivations for the behaviors of self and others, and as such can be seen as directly tapping into our internal self-models.  However, because these studies have typically relied upon self-report measures, soliciting verbal explanations of different scenarios from individual participants, they may  be subject to biases that make interpretation more difficult.  Also, the artificial and counterfactual nature of the scenarios complicates the interpretation of these data [@Malle06].  Two interrelated phenomena have received the most attention:

* The **fundamental attribution error** (FAE) [@Ross77], which is the observed tendency for people to attribute the causes of people's behavior to internal, **dispositional** factors, instead of recognizing relevant **situational** factors.  For example, if we observe someone speeding down the freeway, we tend to say "what a jerk" instead of recognizing that there may be important situational factors causing that behavior (e.g., they may be rushing to the hospital).  More recent discussions of this phenomenon focus on the **correspondence bias** [@GilbertMalone95], which is a more general description of the various causes leading people to focus on attributing behavior to dispositional factors.  In terms of our self-model construct above, one could argue that the dispositional explanation provides a simpler, more compressed account of behavior -- a simplifying heuristic that operates in the absence of a more compelling need to integrate more diverse, and typically less salient, factors in the situation.

* The **actor-observer asymmetry** [@JonesNisbett71] holds that the FAE applies specifically when we are interpreting the behavior of others (i.e., as an observer), but when we are explaining our own behavior as the actor, we actually tend to have the opposite bias, emphasizing situational variables instead of dispositional ones.

Despite all the attention, these findings remain controversial, and a recent metanalysis found no strong evidence for the replicability of the actor-observer asymmetry in general [@Malle06].  Instead, it only held when considering negative behaviors, in which case the bias to attribute self-behavior to situational factors is consistent with the well-established *self-serving bias*, which we consider in more detail below.

## Self and Control

There are many ways in which the critical relationship between the self and **control** has been explored.  First, a number of different phenomena have been associated with a broad **self-serving bias**, that serves to promote and retain a positive **self-concept** [@MillerRoss75].  Numerous studies have shown that people have a tendency to over-estimate their own self-importance and self-worth relative to others [@ShepperdMaloneSweeny08].  For example, self-report measures show that most people think of themselves as being above-average on a range of positive dimensions, and below-average on negative ones. Statistically of course this cannot be the case.  Likewise, you may have experienced the distinct feeling that you do way more of the housework than your roommate or spouse, while they have the exact same feeling about you!

We can understand this self-serving bias as reflecting a strong underlying need to maintain an overall sense of *control* by the self, even if it ends up being illusory.  First, there is the inescapable premise that, if you are in fact in control of yourself, then you only have yourself to blame if things are going badly, so this builds in a strong motivation to inflate your self-evaluations.  And when there may be some stronger indications that things might be going badly, we have a strong tendency to blame others, or those situational factors as discussed above, so as to preserve our own positive self-efficacy ratings.

There are two distinct levels at which this self-serving bias could be operating: a raw motivational level associated with the basic desire for positive vs. negative feelings, and a more cognitive level having to do with retaining the integrity of your overall self-model.  We will return to the motivational level below in the context of *social comparisons*, and focus on the integrity account for now.

One of the most compelling and oft-discussed pheneomena here is **cognitive dissonance** [@Festinger57], which arises when there is a discrepancy between your behavior and your internal self-model.  In such a case, you will tend to either change your self-model to fit your observed behavior (if that is acceptable), or change your behavior to better fit your self-model, or alter your perception of the mismatch in the first place.  Critically, the discrepancy between the behavior and the self-model cannot be left unaddressed -- it is experienced as aversive and must be resolved in some way.  This is consistent with the idea that prediction (or postdiction) errors drive the learning of our self-models: we are highly sensitive to these discrepancies between what our models predict and what actually happens.

The famous experiment testing the predictions of cognitive dissonance had participants performing an hour of boring and monontonous tasks.  Some of the participants were asked to tell the next subject (who was actually a confederate) that the experiment was extremely enjoyable, for which they were either paid $1 or $20.  This lie created dissonance with their actual experience.  All participants then rated how they felt about the task -- those who were paid $1 and experienced the dissonance actually rated the task as significantly more enjoyable than those in the other conditions, presumably because they needed to reconcile the dissonance.  Interestingly, those paid $20 apparently felt sufficiently compensated for lying ($20 was actually a lot of money back then), so they did not experience the same dissonance -- they had another ready explanation for their behavior.

More generally, cognitive dissonance often amounts to *rationalizing*, or coming up with sensible excuses or reasons to explain an anomolous or negative situation.

### Self Control and Intertemporal Choice

Another major domain of investigation in the intersection of self and control is in our capacity for **self control** -- how is it that people can exert control over their behavior, avoiding immediate impulses and raw hedonism in favor of some kind of more "rational", "enlightened", and "socially acceptable" behavior.  We discussed the basic neural mechanisms for **controlled processing** in Chapter 7, depending critically on the ability of the **prefrontal cortex** (PFC) to maintain top-down task and goal information that then shapes neural processing in the rest of the brain.  As noted there, the PFC is ideally situated to integrate motivational signals from its medial and ventral areas, with overall high-level motor planning areas in its dorsal and lateral areas, to serve as a high-level *executive* in directing behaviour to meet the "bottom line" goals and needs of the organism.

However, none of this explains where exactly these goals might come from, and why it is that anyone would *not* just engage in behaviors that immediately produce the greatest amount of pleasure (i.e., pure hedonism).  This is where society, culture, and all those pesky social pressures come in.  In addition to sharing knowledge and technology, a critical role for culture and socialization is to impose behaviors on the individual that are beneficial for the group as a whole, even though they go against individual motivational drives.  In evolutionary theorizing, this has been explained in terms of **group selection** effects, where behaviors that benefit group survival will result in selection pressure in favor of the genes that drive such behavior [@Hamilton63; @Wilson75; @TraulsenNowak06].  One prominent example of such effects is the idea that we are wired to punish cheaters [@FehrGachter02], because they otherwise undermine the fitness of the group.

Again, we see the fundamental tension between the individual and society, and so much of our political dynamics are caught up in this battle, with traditional "right wing" perspectives emphasizing *liberty* and the sanctity of the individual, while traditional "left wing" perspectives emphasize the needs of the larger society and the importance of sacrificing for the benefit of others, even when this means paying higher taxes for example.  The extreme reactions that right-wing individualists have when the state attempts to impose on their perceived freedoms, even when it directly benefits them (e.g., seat belt laws and environmental protections) indicates how strong these tensions can be, and how threatening social pressures are to our own individual self-control models.  In any case, social forces clearly do inject themselves into our internal models of how we should behave, and the direct social forces of *embarrassment* and *ostracism* are powerful levers for shaping our behavior.

One of the most widely cited studies on self control is Walter Mischel's famous **marshmallow task** [@MischelEbbesenRaskoffZeiss72; @MischelShodaRodriguez89], where children could choose to get one marshmallow now, or 2 after a 15 minute wait (i.e., **delay of gratification**).  To a young child of around 4 years of age, waiting 15 minutes staring at a marshmallow is an eternity, so it is rather remarkable that any waited at all.  Even more remarkable was that the extent to which children did wait predicted many later outcomes, such as educational attainment, SAT scores, and even body-mass index (BMI).  The standard interpretation of this data has been that there are strong individual differences in the extent to which people can exert self control (i.e., innate differences in "willpower"), and that this ability to do so is important across many domains.

This account is consistent with the importance of motivational factors in shaping intelligence as discussed in Chapter 7: standard tests of intelligence and working memory require one to invest considerable effort into something that is not immediately gratifying.  And the same can be said for most school environments, which often do not directly engage children's curiosity and desire to learn, and instead rely on a range of more indirect, external motivational supports.  Thus, if someone has the ability to motivate themselves to perform under these circumstances, they will learn more, and enjoy more of the benefits of a good education, etc.

Interestingly, recent marshmallow task studies have shown that social factors such as group identity and various measures of social support can have a strong influence on children's motivation to delay gratification [@DoebelMunakata18; @MichaelsonMunakata20], consistent with the power of these social forces in shaping individual behavior.  Indeed, children of this age will have typically received many "socialization" messages from their parents and others about the importance of not being greedy and sharing with others, etc.

More generally, these tasks are examples of the general problem of **intertemporal choice** -- the fundamental question of whether you want to cash in your chips *now*, or wait for potentially bigger rewards *later*.  J.D. Cohen has observed that almost every decision can be cast as a form of intertemporal choice -- and often there is no obviously correct answer.  Is it worth spending 30+ years of life in school just for the opportunity to become a professor?  Not if you don't like school, that's for sure!  But is it worth going to college, or should you follow in the footsteps of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and just get started on the next big thing?  Or have they now established such formidible monopolies that your chances of replicating that success are likely greatly diminished, and college is a much safer bet.  Should you stick with your current relationship, or look for someone who might be a better fit -- but what if you don't find them?

In movies, these tradeoffs are often played off against each other using the stereotypical "hard working but unhappy stiffs" vs. the "screw-offs who enjoy life".  Interestingly, Hollywood seems to favor the screw-offs.  There are significant cultural differences in these value systems as well: Europeans generally favor a more relaxed, "quality of life" focus (long lunches, shorter working hours, extensive vacations), whereas Americans seem to be more caught up in the "rat race", working long hours to "get ahead".

### Comparison (Contrast), and Power

The interface between social interactions and motivation is not just in the direction of social forces pushing individuals around: individuals are also leveraging the social environment to satisfy various personal needs.  These have been investigated in the context of various phenomena, including *social comparisons*, *impression management*, and *dominance and submission*.

Leon Festinger, who also developed cognitive dissonance theory,  proposed **social comparison theory**, which is based on the hypothesis that people actively compare themselves against others, to satisfy a variety of different core motivations [@Festinger54].  Each such motivation carries with it different considerations and has predictable patterns, which have been tested in numerous experiments over the years.  For example, when evaluating your own level of ability, you should seek out those who you perceive as close to your ability, to provide an informative comparison, but such people will also be more threatening if they prove to be better than you, so you will be biased to seek out others who are likely to be somewhat worse than you.

This is known as **downward social comparison**, and is captured in the German term *schadenfreude*, where pleasure is obtained by witnessing the struggles of an other.  In the context of our core CCC principles, it is an example of **contrast**, where the brain operates by performing relative comparisons, not absolute judgments, and if you have the choice, it is generally more rewarding to come out on the better side of such relative comparisons.  Indeed, considerable research shows that social comparisons of this downward sort predominate.

However, different circumstances can play an important role in determining when you might also compare yourself with others who are likely to be better (**upward social comparison**) [@AspinwallTaylor93].  For example, these upward comparisons can be inspiring, as in the case of positive role models (do we still have any of those?)  Furthermore, while downward social comparisons typically boost your sense of self-esteem, they might also make you feel sorry for the compared other, and thus result in negative overall affect.

In the secondary school environment, and high school especially (at least in the USA), this process of social comparison is ubiquitous, explicit, and often cruel, likely reflecting a basic biological drive to establish a **dominance hierarchy**, which is found in most other long-lasting social structures in the animal kingdom (e.g., within the wolf pack, or groups of great apes).  Given the functional benefits of hierarchies in virtually all known complex systems, from the brain itself to large corporations and the military, this fact of life is likely inevitable, and necessary for the efficient functioning of large groups.  However, it is not clear that it has such benefits in the school setting (its not like the group as such really has to do anything particularly meaningful or challenging), and thus it likely just reflects our basic instincts, reinforced by the individual affective dynamics characterized by social comparison theory.

An important consequence of all this social comparison going on, is the **spotlight effect** [@GilovichSavitsky99], which reflects a somewhat amusing logical error in overgeneralizing from one's own subjective experience: because we spend so much of our mental life engaging in social comparison with others, we naturally assume that *everyone else must be constantly evaluating me* -- i.e., we are constantly under some kind of spotlight.  However, if you think more carefully about your own experience, you realize that you rarely spend too much time actually noticing what any given other person is doing -- most of the time you're more obsessed about *yourself*, with only relatively superficial use of others for comparison purposes.  Thus, in fact, every other person is essentially walking around in their own little bubble of self-obsession, and they actually don't care too much about you.  Unless, of course, you do something really obviously embarrassing, in which case everyone will enjoy a moment of schadenfreude at your expense, and then move back into their bubbles.  This effect is only magnified with everyone walking around staring at their cell phone screens -- they are barely even paying attention enough to avoid getting run over, much less even noticing you.

![**Figure 9.X:** Illustration of the interpersonal circumplex from Wiggins (1996), organized along dominance/submission along the vertical axis, and cold/warmth along the horizontal.](figures/fig_ipc_circumplex_steigenplex.jpg){ width=50% }

Returning to the issue of dominance, the *circumplex* theory of dyadic (two person) interactions, known as the **interpersonal situation** theory [@PincusAnsell03; @HopwoodWrightAnsellEtAl13], interprets the core of these interactions in terms of two different dimensions: **dominance vs. submission** (or **agency**), and **cold vs. warmth** (or **communion**) (Figure 9.X).  Thus, in any interaction, each person occupies a point in the two-dimensional space defined by these axes, and some of these are mutually compatible while others are not.  For example, when two individuals are each seeking to exert dominance, then you get into a classic competitive, combative dynamic (a "pissing contest"), but if one is seeking dominance and the other is actually seeking the safety of a submissive position, then they are mutually compatible.  The cold vs. warmth dimension reflects the overall level of engagement, acceptance, and affiliation communicated in the interaction.  In an early sketch by Timothy Leary, this dimension was labeled as *love* vs. *hate*, which directly ties to in-group vs. out-group membership, as we discuss below [@Wiggins96].

These dimensions appear closely related to Susan Fiske's **stereotype content theory**, which was based on an attempt to reduce the essential social status and impact associated with different stereotypes down to a systematic framework, which converged on two essentially isomorphic dimensions: **competence** and **warmth** [@FiskeCuddyGlickEtAl02].  Although this framework has been applied to interpersonal relationships [@RussellFiske08], it is not clear the direct connection between these two frameworks has been established.  Fiske's framework explicitly associates the warmth axis with in-group vs. out-group status.

In short, there appears to be a very simple, stark social reality captured in these frameworks: people are either on the same team or not, and they are either dominant / competent or submissive / incompetent.  From the biological perspective, this pretty much summarizes exactly what goes on in a social structure like a wolf pack or a troop of gorillas.  However, unlike these cases, people exist in many different social contexts, where they may take on different such positions within the circumplex.  When I'm engaging in most forms of sport, I'm goofy, submissive, and incompetent, whereas in academic circles I'm still goofy (some things never change) but somewhat more competent / dominant.

This framework provides some critical context for understanding the dimensions of individual personality (as we'll see next), and also about the nature of power in human group dynamics, which we cover after that.  Because our brains have almost certainly internalized these basic social dimensions, even if most people may not be so explicitly aware of them, they dictate the nature of politics in important ways.  For better or worse, we are wired to recognize and defer to powerful, dominant people, and we care more about perceived affiliation with a social group than about any rational, economic or other kinds of policy factors.  This explains why populist, despotic leaders are so successful, despite all rational arguments against them: they push our social buttons.  The extreme form of such social structures leads naturally to fascism, strongly polarizing people along in-group vs. out-group dimensions (using convenient scapegoats to reinforce the affiliation of the in-group), and presenting overwhelming images of dominance (typically in the form of a strong father figure -- has there been a female despot yet?).
