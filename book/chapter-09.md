# Chapter 9: Personality and Social Psychology

One of the most prominent biologically-grounded theories for what makes human beings so successful as a species centers on our social orientation and the evolutionary forces that have shaped us to become so strongly dependent on others for our basic survival.  Specifically, in comparing human infants with our closest primate relatives, Michael Tomasello concluded that people have an innate desire to *share* (experiences, emotions, information, resources) that is notably stronger than in chimpanzees or other great apes [@Tomasello01].  This desire to share forms the foundation of *culture*, and without everything that we get from our culture, we are not much different than any other ape.  Culture (social transmission of knowledge) gives us *everything*: knowledge of which foods to eat and which to avoid, how to prepare them to maximize energy content (i.e., how to start a fire and grill stuff), how to farm, how to make tools, from primitive stone through all of the major "ages" of human history, up to now, the "information age", where it seems that every living being spends all their time *sharing* every last detail of their lives over the internet!

The social forces of *identity* and *belonging* rise to a crescendo through adolescence, driving so many seemingly irrational behaviors --- and by the time they become parents, somehow people forget what this time was like, and expect their kids to just be "normal", like they were a few years earlier.  This is the time when the mysterious evolutionary forces wielded by *hormones* turn our attention so strongly outward, to shape so fatefully our future roles in the larger world.  Much of literature and film remains obsessed with this *coming of age* dynamic which lies at the core of the *hero's journey*, recognized by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 book [@Campbell49] as the underlying plot structure of many stories from ancient mythology through to the modern day.

The plot starts with the relative comfort and security of childhood, which is disturbed by some kind of threat or call to adventure.  This is the impetus to leave the nest, which is initially refused, but stronger forces (often supernatural) conspire to force a crossing of the point of no return --- out into the mysterious wider world, where previously unknown strengths and abilities are discovered, and a newfound self understanding begins to emerge, often through social isolation.  In many cultures, this is ritualized in various *rites of passage* or *initiations* (e.g., bar / bat mitzvah; tattooing in Samoa) marking the transition to adulthood, and accompanied by an explicit process of separation, followed by various tests and challenges.  This deep-seated initiation schema is also employed to strong effect in cults, which likewise require rejection of the previous "normal" life, and often significant physical, painful acts that test and demonstrate their convictions.

One of the major hero's journey plot points involves learning about romantic love, and another, especially for the male-dominated version of the story, involves the oedipal conquest of some kind of dominant father figure, which represents the ultimate test and door to true freedom and self realization.  There's also a key role for various guides and teachers in helping the hero along (yay teachers!)  Finally, the victorious hero returns back to the homeland, bringing some kind of critical benefit (e.g., saving the world from ultimate destruction).  The plot of the Star Wars saga (episodes 4-6) illustrates this journey perfectly, where the hapless Luke is wrest from his family and must find his inner jedi across a series of tests, ultimately conquering his actual father in the ultimate battle to save the world from certain destruction.

The power and pervasiveness of this hero's journey *monomyth* speaks to the depth of social forces in shaping our identities, goals, and understanding of the world around us.  And from a more practical, functional perspective, the fundamentally *open-ended* nature of these social forces is critical for driving the open-ended, adaptive nature of human behavior and cognition.  Given the importance of motivation in driving learning and intelligence, social forces provide a strong biologically-grounded motivational system that continuously changes as function of the ever-changing culture that surrounds us.  Food and drink just do not have that same open-ended character (what, chicken *again*?), and it is striking that the spontaneous language production of apes who have been taught sign language is just endless blabbering about these basic necessities of life --- compare with the average teenager who only wants to talk about meaningless stuff with their friends, and you can really see Tomasello's point.

In other words, other apes never ascend beyond the bottom level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Figure 5.9), and this hierarchy is really the ladder that has enabled us to climb our way up into our current "enlightened" state of being.  The human child is strongly driven by love and belonging in the family context, and adolescence is all about moving to the next level up, of esteem, confidence, achievement, and respect from (and of) others.  Once you become a jedi master, you ascend to the highest level of self-actualization.

Despite the dominance of social forces in shaping us, or perhaps because of it, people have a tendency to underestimate and outright reject the strength of these forces, especially in some cultures.  For example, in the strongly individualistic western cultures such as the USA, many people cultivate the image of the individual as essentially self-sufficient, and those who depend on society as weak and inferior.  However, such people seriously underestimate how significantly their views are shaped by various social influences, and how completely their lives depend on the actions and good will of others.  Our general fascination with castaways likely stems from this basic conflict and longing for individual freedom in the face of all this social pressure!

This fundamental conflict between the individual and social forces is one of the major topics of social psychology, for example in exploring how people explain the behavior of self an others, known as *attribution* theory.  For example, the *fundamental attribution error* [@Ross77] is the tendency for people to over-emphasize *dispositional* attributes and under-emphasize *situational* factors, consistent with the individualistic, western-style mindset.

This conflict is also at the center of personality psychology, which has wrestled with the fundamental question of the extent to which there are strong, stable, coherent dispositional *traits* driving people's behavior across a range of different situations.  Early challenges to personality psychology argued that most of behavior was driven by situational factors [@Mischel68], but there is now a strong consensus around the *Big Five* personality factors that have been replicated across many studies.  Most of these factors concern the interaction between the individual and their social environment, suggesting again the importance of social forces in shaping who we are.

In short, social and personality psychology as a field is focused on this critical interface between the individual and the broader social environment, and, in part due to practical limitations, empirical studies often only involve a single individual, or a dyad (one of whom is often a *confederate* in the experiment, acting out a prescribed role).  Considerable theorizing in the field is centered around the construct of the *self*: what kind of internal model do we have of ourselves, how does this self-concept change as a result of different kinds of social interactions, and how does it shape our own behavior?  Despite this seemingly individual-focused perspective, there is a basic assumption that our self-understanding emerges out of our social interactions with others, and that our sense of self would be greatly diminished if we lived alone on a deserted island.

We begin our discussion by connecting some of the core ideas in social and personality psychology with the central themes developed in the earlier chapters, showing how all three of the C's (compression, contrast, and control) play leading roles here.  

## The Subjective and Objective Self

Perhaps to an even greater degree than in other domains of psychology, social and personality psychology wrestles directly with the challenges of creating a science out of the subjective, first-person perspective.  The notion of the *self* is, obviously, grounded inevitably in our own subjective experiences, and much of the data collected is in the form of **self-report** about the nature of these subjective experiences.  Considerable effort has been made to cross-validate these self-report measures with other more objective measures, and although systematic biases are likely to exist, and there is a considerable amount of noise in any of these measures, to a remarkable extent people are willing to share even socially undesirable features of themselves with inquiring scientists [@Paulhus91; @PodsakoffMacKenzieJeong-YeonLeeEtAl03; @Chan09].

More recently, social psychologists have developed a number of clever techniques that bypass explicit self reports and tap more directly into *implicit* internal representations [@GreenwaldMcGheeSchwartz98] that are less likely to be contaminated by self-report biases.  These techniques have revealed the pervasive and insidous nature of stereotypes in ways that other techniques had not [@NosekSmythHansenEtAl07].

In contrast with the more subjectively focused notions of the self, *personality* has come to be operationalized and understood more from the objective, outside perspective.  Specifically, the *Big Five* personality factors focus on patterns of overt *behavior*, and there is a strong concern for validating these measures between self-report and the reports of other people (friends, relatives), and across different cultures [@McCraeCostaMartinEtAl04; @McCraeCosta97].  Furthermore, the central reliance on the empirical, statistical technique of factor analysis, instead of a more theoretically-driven approach, results in a more objectively-focused framework.

## The Predictive Self-Model

To ground our understanding of the *self* in terms of the neural mechanisms of learning, motivation, and perception developed in the previous chapters, we can view the self as a high-level internal mental model that emerges as a result of predictive, error-driven learning in order to **compress** and simplify our subjective experiences.  We experience a continuous stream of actions, emotions, motivations, and sensations --- by integrating these into a coherent overall predictive model, the **self-model**, we can achieve a simpler high-level encoding of all of these diverse states.

Thus, the self is just like any other stable factor that we perceive in the world (like size, color, shape, etc) --- to the extent that it provides a simpler, more compressed way of understanding (and predicting) what we experience, we perceive this stable construct instead of a more jumbled collection of stimuli.  In other words, we have *self-constancy* in the same way that we have size-constancy and all the other constancies as discussed in the perception chapter.

A compelling demonstration for how our subjective sense of self could emerge from an internal model that is driven by predicting diverse multi-modal sensory inputs is provided by the **rubber hand illusion** [@BotvinickCohen98]. In this experiment, people (myself included --- I was a participant!) experienced a striking subjective sensation that a rubber hand was their own hand, due to the convergence of visual and somatosensory sensations associated with synchronous brushing of the real hand and the rubber hand.  In other words, you see the rubber hand being brushed, and feel at precisely the same moment your own hand being brushed, and the simplest explanation for your brain is that you are looking at your own hand being brushed.  Like the illusions you experienced in the perception chapter, the power of this demonstration is in the immediate subjective experience of self-ness attributed to the obviously rubber hand --- it is truly freaky, and unfortunate that we cannot easily reproduce it in this book.

These basic learning forces that create an internal self-model could also then be responsible for producing the behavior of **mirror neurons**, which appear to encode the intentions of motor actions produced by either the self or someone else that you are observing [@IacoboniWoodsRizzolatti99; @IacoboniDapretto06].  In other words, we learn the self-model to provide a compressed, predictive representation of everything that we experience, but once it has been learned, it can then become activated by other partial sensory inputs, i.e., visual input of another person's action, without all of the other subjective somatosensory stimuli associated with our own actions.

Critically, this ability to map the actions of others into our own internal self-model then enables us to also learn more directly from the experiences and behaviors of others --- i.e., through **imitation** and more general forms of *vicarious*, *observational* learning, as we discussed in Chapter 5.  To reiterate from that discussion, it is most likely that the capacity for imitation depends on extensive sensory-motor learning, and emerges progressively along with this learning over a protracted period of development [@Jones09a; @Paulus14].  This emerging self-model can then provide the foundation upon which many other social processes take place, by enabling us to perform the critical function of translating our third-person perspective on the behaviors of others into our own first-person subjective understanding for *why* other people might behave in the way they do (i.e., **empathy** and **theory-of-mind**, as we discuss below).

This neuroscience-based framework converges nicely with some of the dominant theoretical perspectives developed within the field of social psychology, particularly the **social learning theory** developed by Albert Bandura [@Bandura77a], which has had a tremendous impact on many fields outside of psychology as well, especially education and business.  The core elements of this theory are that people can learn by observing the behaviors of others, and the outcomes that others experience (i.e., **vicarious reinforcement**).  Another crucial element of this framework is that people are not merely passive experiencers of reward and punishment, but rather play an active role in shaping their own environment and their own sense of **self efficacy** [@Bandura77].  This is consistent with the central role of **control** and the nature of our motivational systems, as discussed in Chapter 5.

In the following sections, we discuss a number of widely-studied phenomena and theories that inform our understanding of how this self-model might function.

## Attributions

**Attribution theory** has been highly impactful in social psychology --- it directly concerns the explicit judgments ("attributions") that people make about motivations for the behaviors of self and others, and as such can be seen as directly tapping into our internal self-models.  However, because these studies have typically relied upon self-report measures, soliciting verbal explanations of different scenarios from individual participants, they may  be subject to biases that make interpretation more difficult.  Also, the artificial and counterfactual nature of the scenarios complicates the interpretation of these data [@Malle06].  Two interrelated phenomena have received the most attention:

* The **fundamental attribution error** (FAE) [@Ross77], which is the observed tendency for people to attribute the causes of people's behavior to internal, **dispositional** factors, instead of recognizing relevant **situational** factors.  For example, if we observe someone speeding down the freeway, we tend to say "what a jerk" instead of recognizing that there may be important situational factors causing that behavior (e.g., they may be rushing to the hospital).  More recent discussions of this phenomenon focus on the **correspondence bias** [@GilbertMalone95], which is a more general description of the various causes leading people to focus on attributing behavior to dispositional factors.  In terms of our self-model construct above, one could argue that the dispositional explanation provides a simpler, more compressed account of behavior --- a simplifying heuristic that operates in the absence of a more compelling need to integrate more diverse, and typically less salient, factors in the situation.

* The **actor-observer asymmetry** [@JonesNisbett71] holds that the FAE applies specifically when we are interpreting the behavior of others (i.e., as an observer), but when we are explaining our own behavior as the actor, we actually tend to have the opposite bias, emphasizing situational variables instead of dispositional ones.

Despite all the attention, these findings remain controversial, and a recent metanalysis found no strong evidence for the replicability of the actor-observer asymmetry in general [@Malle06].  Instead, it only held when considering negative behaviors, in which case the bias to attribute self-behavior to situational factors is consistent with the well-established *self-serving bias*, which we consider next.

## Self and Control

There are many ways in which the critical relationship between the self and **control** has been explored.  First, a number of different phenomena have been associated with a broad **self-serving bias**, that serves to promote and retain a positive **self-concept** [@MillerRoss75].  Numerous studies have shown that people have a tendency to over-estimate their own self-importance and self-worth relative to others [@ShepperdMaloneSweeny08].  For example, self-report measures show that most people think of themselves as being above-average on a range of positive dimensions, and below-average on negative ones. Statistically of course this cannot be the case (cue the *Lake Woebegone* theme song...).  Likewise, you may have experienced the distinct feeling that you do way more of the housework than your roommate or spouse, while they have the exact same feeling about you!

We can understand this self-serving bias as reflecting a strong underlying need to maintain an overall sense of *control* by the self, even if it ends up being illusory.  First, there is the inescapable premise that, if you are in fact in control of yourself, then you only have yourself to blame if things are going badly, so this builds in a strong motivation to inflate your self-evaluations.  And when there may be some stronger indications that things might be going badly, we have a strong tendency to blame others, or those situational factors as discussed above, so as to preserve our own positive self-efficacy ratings.  The alternatives, admitting that we suck, or that we are actually *not* in control of our own selves, are not really that tenable.

There are two distinct levels at which this self-serving bias could be operating: a raw motivational level associated with the basic desire for positive vs. negative feelings, and a more cognitive level having to do with retaining the integrity of your overall self-model.  We will return to the motivational level below in the context of *social comparisons*, and focus on the integrity account for now.

One of the most compelling and oft-discussed pheneomena here is **cognitive dissonance** [@Festinger57], which arises when there is a discrepancy between your behavior and your internal self-model.  In such a case, you will tend to either change your self-model to fit your observed behavior (if that is acceptable), or change your behavior to better fit your self-model, or alter your perception of the mismatch in the first place.  Critically, the discrepancy between the behavior and the self-model cannot be left unaddressed --- it is experienced as aversive and must be resolved in some way.  This is consistent with the idea that prediction (or postdiction) errors drive the learning of our self-models: we are highly sensitive to these discrepancies between what our models predict and what actually happens.

The famous experiment testing the predictions of cognitive dissonance had participants performing an hour of boring and monontonous tasks.  Some of the participants were asked to tell the next subject (who was actually a confederate) that the experiment was extremely enjoyable, for which they were either paid $1 or $20.  This lie created dissonance with their actual experience.  All participants then rated how they felt about the task --- those who were paid $1 and experienced the dissonance actually rated the task as significantly more enjoyable than those in the other conditions, presumably because they needed to reconcile the dissonance.  Interestingly, those paid $20 apparently felt sufficiently compensated for lying ($20 was actually a lot of money back then), so they did not experience the same dissonance --- they had another ready explanation for their behavior.

More generally, cognitive dissonance often amounts to *rationalizing*, or coming up with sensible excuses or reasons to explain an anomolous or negative situation.

### Self Control and Intertemporal Choice

An obvious domain of investigation in the intersection of self and control is in our capacity for **self control** --- how is it that people can exert control over their behavior, avoiding immediate impulses and raw hedonism in favor of some kind of more "rational", "enlightened", and "socially acceptable" behavior?  We discussed the basic neural mechanisms for **controlled processing** in Chapter 7, depending critically on the ability of the **prefrontal cortex** (PFC) to maintain top-down task and goal information that then shapes neural processing in the rest of the brain.  As noted there, the PFC is ideally situated to integrate motivational signals from its medial and ventral areas, with overall high-level motor planning areas in its dorsal and lateral areas, to serve as a high-level *executive* in directing behaviour to meet the "bottom line" goals and needs of the organism.

However, none of this explains where exactly these goals might come from, and why it is that anyone would *not* just engage in behaviors that immediately produce the greatest amount of pleasure (i.e., pure hedonism).  This is where society, culture, and all those pesky social pressures come in.  In addition to sharing knowledge and technology, a critical role for culture and socialization is to impose behaviors on the individual that are beneficial for the group as a whole, even though they go against individual motivational drives.  In evolutionary theorizing, this has been explained in terms of **group selection** effects, where behaviors that benefit group survival will result in selection pressure in favor of the genes that drive such behavior [@Hamilton63; @Wilson75; @TraulsenNowak06].  One prominent example of such effects is the idea that we are wired to punish cheaters [@FehrGachter02], because they otherwise undermine the fitness of the group.

Again, we see the fundamental tension between the individual and society, and so much of our political dynamics are caught up in this battle, with traditional "right wing" perspectives emphasizing *liberty* and the sanctity of the individual, while traditional "left wing" perspectives emphasize the needs of the larger society and the importance of sacrificing for the benefit of others, even when this means paying higher taxes for example.  The extreme reactions that right-wing individualists have when the state attempts to impose on their perceived freedoms, even when it directly benefits them (e.g., seat belt laws and environmental protections) indicates how strong these tensions can be, and how threatening social pressures are to our own individual self-control models.  In any case, social forces clearly do inject themselves into our internal models of how we should behave, and the direct social forces of *embarrassment* and *ostracism* are powerful levers for shaping our behavior.

One of the most widely cited studies on self control is Walter Mischel's famous **marshmallow task** [@MischelEbbesenRaskoffZeiss72; @MischelShodaRodriguez89], where children could choose to get one marshmallow now, or 2 after a 15 minute wait (i.e., **delay of gratification**).  To a young child of around 4 years of age, waiting 15 minutes staring at a marshmallow is an eternity, so it is rather remarkable that any waited at all.  Even more remarkable was that the extent to which children did wait predicted many later outcomes, such as educational attainment, SAT scores, and even body-mass index (BMI).  The standard interpretation of this data has been that there are strong individual differences in the extent to which people can exert self control (i.e., innate differences in "willpower"), and that this ability to do so is important across many domains.

This account is consistent with the importance of motivational factors in shaping intelligence as discussed in Chapter 7: standard tests of intelligence and working memory require one to invest considerable effort into something that is not immediately gratifying.  And the same can be said for most school environments, which often do not directly engage children's curiosity and desire to learn, and instead rely on a range of more indirect, external motivational supports.  Thus, if someone has the ability to motivate themselves to perform under these circumstances, they will learn more, and enjoy more of the benefits of a good education, etc.

Interestingly, recent marshmallow task studies have shown that social factors such as group identity and various measures of social support can have a strong influence on children's motivation to delay gratification [@DoebelMunakata18; @MichaelsonMunakata20], consistent with the power of these social forces in shaping individual behavior.  Indeed, children of this age will have typically received many "socialization" messages from their parents and others about the importance of not being greedy and sharing with others, etc.

More generally, these tasks are examples of the general problem of **intertemporal choice** --- the fundamental question of whether you want to cash in your chips *now*, or wait for potentially bigger rewards *later*.  J.D. Cohen has observed that almost every decision can be cast as a form of intertemporal choice --- and often there is no obviously correct answer.  Is it worth spending 30+ years of life in school just for the opportunity to become a professor?  Not if you don't like school, that's for sure!  But is it worth going to college, or should you follow in the footsteps of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg and just get started on the next big thing?  Or have they now established such formidible monopolies that your chances of replicating that success are likely greatly diminished, and college is a much safer bet?  Should you stick with your current relationship, or look for someone who might be a better fit --- but what if you don't find them?

In movies, these tradeoffs are often played off against each other using the stereotypical "hard working but unhappy stiffs" vs. the "screw-offs who enjoy life".  Interestingly, Hollywood seems to favor the screw-offs.  There are significant cultural differences in these value systems as well: Europeans generally favor a more relaxed, "quality of life" focus (long lunches, shorter working hours, extensive vacations), whereas Americans seem to be more caught up in the "rat race", working long hours to "get ahead".

### Comparison (Contrast), and Power

The interface between social interactions and motivation is not just in the direction of social forces pushing individuals around: individuals are also leveraging the social environment to satisfy various personal needs.  These have been investigated in the context of various phenomena, including *social comparisons*, *impression management*, and *dominance and submission*.

Leon Festinger, who also developed cognitive dissonance theory,  proposed **social comparison theory**, which is based on the hypothesis that people actively compare themselves against others, to satisfy a variety of different core motivations [@Festinger54].  Each such motivation carries with it different considerations and has predictable patterns, which have been tested in numerous experiments over the years.  For example, when evaluating your own level of ability, you should seek out those who you perceive as close to your ability, to provide an informative comparison, but such people will also be more threatening if they prove to be better than you, so you will be biased to seek out others who are likely to be somewhat worse than you.

This is known as **downward social comparison**, and is captured in the German term *schadenfreude*, where pleasure is obtained by witnessing the struggles of an other.  In the context of our core CCC principles, it is an example of **contrast**, where the brain operates by performing relative comparisons, not absolute judgments, and if you have the choice, it is generally more rewarding to come out on the better side of such relative comparisons.  Indeed, considerable research shows that social comparisons of this downward sort predominate.

However, different circumstances can play an important role in determining when you might also compare yourself with others who are likely to be better (**upward social comparison**) [@AspinwallTaylor93].  For example, these upward comparisons can be inspiring, as in the case of positive role models (do we still have any of those?)  Furthermore, while downward social comparisons typically boost your sense of self-esteem, they might also make you feel sorry for the compared other, and thus result in negative overall affect.

In the secondary school environment, and high school especially (at least in the USA), this process of social comparison is ubiquitous, explicit, and often cruel, likely reflecting a basic biological drive to establish a **dominance hierarchy**, which is found in most other long-lasting social structures in the animal kingdom (e.g., within the wolf pack, or groups of great apes).  Given the functional benefits of hierarchies in virtually all known complex systems, from the brain itself to large corporations and the military, this fact of life is likely inevitable, and necessary for the efficient functioning of large groups.  However, it is not clear that it has such benefits in the school setting (its not like the group as such really has to do anything particularly meaningful or challenging), and thus it likely just reflects our basic instincts, reinforced by the individual affective dynamics characterized by social comparison theory.

An important consequence of all this social comparison going on, is the **spotlight effect** [@GilovichSavitsky99], which reflects a somewhat amusing logical error in overgeneralizing from one's own subjective experience: because we spend so much of our mental life engaging in social comparison with others, we naturally assume that *everyone else must be constantly evaluating me* --- i.e., we are constantly under some kind of spotlight.  However, if you think more carefully about your own experience, you realize that you rarely spend too much time actually noticing what any given other person is doing --- most of the time you're more obsessed about *yourself*, with only relatively superficial use of others for comparison purposes.  Thus, in fact, every other person is essentially walking around in their own little bubble of self-obsession, and they actually don't care too much about you.  Unless, of course, you do something really obviously embarrassing, in which case everyone will enjoy a moment of schadenfreude at your expense, and then move back into their bubbles.  This effect is only magnified with everyone walking around staring at their cell phone screens --- they are barely even paying attention enough to avoid getting run over, much less even noticing you.

![**Figure 9.X:** Illustration of the interpersonal circumplex from Wiggins (1996), organized along dominance/submission along the vertical axis, and cold/warmth along the horizontal.](figures/fig_ipc_circumplex_steigenplex.jpg){ width=50% }

Returning to the issue of dominance, the *circumplex* theory of dyadic (two person) interactions, known as the **interpersonal situation** theory [@PincusAnsell03; @HopwoodWrightAnsellEtAl13], interprets the core of these interactions in terms of two different dimensions: **dominance vs. submission** (or **agency**), and **cold vs. warmth** (or **communion**) (Figure 9.X).  Thus, in any interaction, each person occupies a point in the two-dimensional space defined by these axes, and some of these are mutually compatible while others are not.  For example, when two individuals are each seeking to exert dominance, then you get into a classic competitive, combative dynamic (a "pissing contest"), but if one is seeking dominance and the other is actually seeking the safety of a submissive position, then they are mutually compatible.  The extremes of this dimension characterize *sadomasochistic* relationships between the dominant sadist and subordinate mascochist.

The cold vs. warmth dimension reflects the overall level of engagement, acceptance, and affiliation communicated in the interaction.  In an early sketch by Timothy Leary, this dimension was labeled as *love* vs. *hate*, which directly ties to in-group vs. out-group membership, as we discuss below [@Wiggins96].

These dimensions appear closely related to Susan Fiske's **stereotype content theory**, which was based on an attempt to reduce the essential social status and impact associated with different stereotypes down to a systematic framework, which converged on two essentially isomorphic dimensions: **competence** and **warmth** [@FiskeCuddyGlickEtAl02].  Although this framework has been applied to interpersonal relationships [@RussellFiske08], it is not clear the direct connection between these two frameworks has been established.  Fiske's framework explicitly associates the warmth axis with in-group vs. out-group status.

In short, there appears to be a very simple, stark social reality captured in these frameworks: people are either on the same team or not, and they are either dominant / competent or submissive / incompetent.  From the biological perspective, this pretty much summarizes exactly what goes on in a social structure like a wolf pack or a troop of gorillas.  However, unlike these cases, people exist in many different social contexts, where they may take on different such positions within the circumplex.  When I'm engaging in most forms of sport, I'm goofy, submissive, and incompetent, whereas in academic circles I'm still goofy (some things never change) but somewhat more competent / dominant.

This framework provides some critical context for understanding the dimensions of individual personality (as we'll see next), and also about the nature of power in human group dynamics, which we cover after that.  Because our brains have almost certainly internalized these basic social dimensions, even if most people may not be so explicitly aware of them, they dictate the nature of politics in important ways.  For better or worse, we are wired to recognize and defer to powerful, dominant people, and we care more about perceived affiliation with a social group than about any rational, economic or other kinds of policy factors.  This explains why populist, despotic leaders are so successful, despite all rational arguments against them: they push our social buttons.  The extreme form of such social structures leads naturally to fascism, strongly polarizing people along in-group vs. out-group dimensions (using convenient scapegoats to reinforce the affiliation of the in-group), and presenting overwhelming images of dominance (typically in the form of a strong father figure --- has there been a female despot yet?). 

## Personality

Who are you, really?  Would you be essentially the same person if you got switched at birth, and grew up in a different family?  A different country?  A different era?  These are some of the deepest and unanswerable (counterfactual) questions in psychology.  No harm in speculating anyway --- what do you think?  How much are you a product of your environment, versus some kind of internal "essence" that defines you?  To what extent do you behave consistently across different situations, on a moment-by-moment or day-by-day basis?

Walter Mischel (the same of marsmallow fame) [@Mischel68] challenged the idea that there is *anything* significantly consistent across time, and that most of human behavior is purely situational.  This flies in the face of most people's subjective perceptions, and there is now substantial evidence that there are indeed stable individual **traits** that can be identified through a variety of methods.  Behavior in any given situation is always going to be a product of the details of the situation as it interacts with these personality traits, and knowing the traits certainly does not provide a perfect prediction of what an individual will do (where's *free will* anyway!?), but people are not identical or completely random either.

Although we cannot answer the above provocative counterfactual questions for any given individual, we can find some pretty interesting and informative approximations to them.  For example, identical twins who were separated at birth do tend to be fairly similar, sometimes in really idiosyncratic and striking ways, as in the Jim Twins [@Segal12]:

> both got terrible migraines, bit their nails, smoked Salem cigarettes, drove light blue Chevrolets, did poorly in spelling and math, and had worked at McDonald’s and as part-time deputy sheriffs. But the weirdest part was that one of the Jim twins had named his first son James Alan. The other had named his first son James Allan. Both had named their pet dogs “Toy.” Both had also married women named Linda—then they got divorced, and both married women named Betty

However, this case is exceptional, and when you look at larger samples and do the relevant *behavioral genetics* analyses (which we'll learn about in detail in the next chapter), the heritability of personality factors is about 0.5 or so (where 1 is perfect genetic determinism and 0 is none) [@PowerPluess15].

Being a parent of multiple children also provides an important perspective on this question.  When you have your first child, you are very concerned about everything, and especially about possibly ruining your child in some incidental, horrifying way.  But when you have your second child, you start to see how very different the two kids can be, even with the same parents, and, as the saying goes, you transition from being an empiricist to a nativist --- maybe the environment has less impact than I thought (and now I can relax a bit --- the kid is going to be who he is going to be after all).  Again, as we'll see in the next chapter, the real answer seems to be about 0.5 for most things of interest.  So you can just half-worry ;)

What you also notice as a parent is that your kids start out with a kind of raw, unformed essence, termed **temperament**, which slowly blossoms into a more fully-formed personality over the years.  Although controversial, there is a general consensus that temperament refers to more biologically-determined individual differences, present early in development, while personality is more associated with later-developing, socially-influenced factors.

As we go through these different temperament and personality dimensions, it is important to remember that, truly, each person is unique and that these are just the most basic dimensions along which people might vary.  Each of these dimensions can be (and have been) further subdivided, and no individual fits perfectly in any such neat category.  Also, there is a overarching goal of finding maximally *separable*, *independent* factors, such that people have reasonable variance along each of these dimensions, across the population.

Also, it is interesting to ponder why we have such a variety of different personality types in the human population in the first place, especially because some of them seem fairly *socially undesirable* --- why haven't those been weeded out by evolution?  A logical conclusion is that society actually benefits as a whole by having diversity in the first place, and even by having people with characteristics that make them difficult to deal with.  For example, by all accounts, Steve Jobs was pretty much an asshole, but look at the tremendous impact he has had on our world!  We can also see examples of this in literature, for example in the *Harry Potter* universe, Snape (and Slytherins more generally) seem like the "bad guys", but actually they play really essential roles (hopefully that is not giving too much away at this point ;)

### Dimensions of Temperament

The notion of temperament has a long history going back to Greek philosophy, in terms of the *four humours*, based on bodily fluids (blood, bile, phlegm): *melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguine, and choleric*.  These can be organized into the interpersonal circumplex (Figure 9.X), in terms of cold / warm and dominant / submissive (which is relabeled as energetic vs not), where they occupy the different quadrants [@Wiggins96].  For example sanguine (blood) is warm and energetic, while melancholic (which refers to black bile) is cold and inactive (depressed).  These dimensions have also been mapped onto extraversion and neuroticism in Hans Eysenck's influential theory of personality [@Eysenck67].

Many different taxonomies have been developed since, without a clear modern consensus emerging.  The single strongest dimension across time has been some kind of **activation** versus **inhibition** dimension (i.e., dominant / submissive or energetic vs. not), which has been strongly emphasized in the **BIS / BAS** (behavioral inhibition system / behavioral activation system) framework [@Gray82; @CarverWhite94; @PickeringGray99].  BIS / BAS maps onto the fundamental behaviors of avoidance vs. approach, which can then be studied across species.  One recent, ambitious project in temperament research is an attempt to directly connect dimensions of temperament with underlying neuromodulatory systems in the brain [@TrofimovaRobbins16; @TrofimovaRobbinsSulisEtAl18].  

### Dimensions of Personality

In contrast with temperament, the field of personality has converged around a core set of personality dimensions, independently discovered by a number of different groups, known as the **Big Five**, which go by the acronym of **OCEAN** [@McCraeCosta97; @McCraeCostaMartinEtAl04].  These dimensions have been identified in a purely data-driven way, by using the statistical technique of **factor analysis**, which mathematically extracts the independent dimensions that best account for the variability across people in a sample of data.  These same five factors have been repeatedly found across a range of different studies, providing reassurance that they are capturing something "real" about people.  Furthermore, these factors align with other longstanding and theoretically-motivated dimensions [@Eysenck67].

One of these dimensions, **extraversion / introversion**, clearly relates to the activation / inhibition temperament factors, and also to the dominant / submissive factor identified as so central to social interactions.  In addition, the **agreeableness** factor clearly seems related to the *warmth* factor discussed above, but instead of being associated with a particular in-group / out-group situation, this personality-level factor refers to a general stable disposition toward warmth across situations.

To help illustrate these dimensions, we take advantage of the *Harry Potter* houses, some of which map clearly onto different dimensions [@CryselCookSchemberEtAl15].  In addition, we include the two "sub factors" or *facets* of each dimension, which have been identified and appear to resolve some ambiguities about the overall factors [@DeYoungQuiltyPeterson07].

* **Openness to experience** reflects an individual's tendency to seek out new experiences, and challenge themselves by entertaining new, unusual ideas, and are overall more creative.  The opposite, **closed** end of the spectrum is associated with more conservative, pragmatic, "hard nosed" attitudes.  This dimension may be a kind of activation temperament within the intellectual sphere, in the same way that extraversion is an activation temperament toward social interactions.

    + **Truth vs. Beauty** are (alternate names for) the two facets of this dimension, reflecting different potential orientations toward intellectual vs. aesthetic spheres.  Officially, these are labeled Intellect vs. Openness, but that seems a bit confusing; Truth vs. Beauty was proposed by [@Johnson94a].  In the *Harry Potter* universe, Luna Lovegood seems like the epitome of aesthetic openness, while the other Ravenclaws may be more strongly aligned with the Truth facet.

* **Conscientiousness** is closely related to the self-control behavior that we discussed in the context of the marshmallow task --- a strong motivation to be prepared, and ability to control impulses and behave in a socially-desirable manner.  On the low end of this dimension are people who are more spontaneous, impulsive, unreliable, and sloppy.  Scoring high on conscientiousness is associated with academic success and health outcomes, among others, which makes sense given the prior discussion of the relevant motivational factors driving success in school.

    + **Industriousness vs. Orderliness** are the two facets, reflecting "hard working" vs. "organized, prepared" differences.  In the *Harry Potter* universe, Hufflepuffs exemplify the Industriousness facet of conscientiousness, while Ravenclaws perhaps represent Orderliness.

* **Extraversion / Introversion** is well-known and widely recognized in popular culture: some people are "people people" and other people are not.  Extraverts get energized by social interaction, while introverts find it draining.  Extraversion can be thought of as an activation temperament in the social domain, and is associated with dominance in the interpersonal circumplex framework, while introversion is on the submissive, inhibited end of the scale.

    + **Enthusiasm vs. Assertivenss** are the two facets, with Enthusiasm reflecting a more generalized approach / engaged / active behavioral profile, while Assertiveness is more specifically connected to Dominance in the social domain, and in general the Assertiveness factor is also called Sociability in other work.  In the *Harry Potter* case, Enthusiasm fits well with the protagonist school of Gryffindor, whereas Assertiveness may be more associated with Slytherins. 

* **Agreeableness** reflects the degree of positive social orientation generally expressed toward in-group members --- some people are just more warm and cooperative than others.  By contrast, **disagreeable** people place self-interest above cooperation.  From an overall social dynamics perspective, if everyone was too agreeable, there might not be enough individual strength to achieve important individual missions --- think of the Steve Jobs example.  Also, there is some evidence that being disagreeable is good for military leadership positions (think drill seargent), and Han Solo from Star Wars was famously selfish but also quite valuable (and more agreeable in the end).

    + **Compassion vs. Politeness** are the two facets, which are useful for distinguishing a more "genuine" empathetic warmth, as compared to a more formal proclivity toward positive social interactions and avoiding negative interpersonal dynamics.  In the *Harry Potter* universe, Hufflepuffs are the epitome of the compassion aspect of agreeableness, while Slytherins represent an interesting case where they are generally selfish and thus low in overall agreeableness, but also can be polite (e.g., Tom Riddle at school, and Professor Slughorn's obsequious form of warmth).

* **Neuroticism** is also widely recognized in everyday folk psychology, as a propensity for anxiety, and strong emotional reactions.  It is also known as *emotional instability* --- experiencing a high variability of emotional responses.  It is contrasted on the low end of the scale with a more calm, emotionally stable outlook.  Various considerations suggest that neuroticism and introversion may be more strongly associated than you would expect if these were really independent factors, for example both are associated with an increased propensity toward anxiety disorders [@BienvenuSamuelsCostaEtAl04], and they are combined in the behavioral inhibition construct.  However, you can probably think of people who are high in both extraversion and neuroticism (very social, but also very emotionally reactive and variable), and also people who are introverted but also calm (that's me, for example).

    + **Volatility vs. Withdrawal** are the two facets, where Withdrawal captures the more consistently anxious and depressive subtype, while volatility captures a more active, angry, impulsive aspect of emotional instability.

As noted above, these Big Five factors align with existing theoretically-derived dimensions, but there are also some areas of potential confusion on these precise relationships.  For example the simpler two-factor theory of extraversion and neuroticism [@Eysenck67] interprets the cold / warm axis from the interpersonal circumplex and Susan Fiske's framework as neuroticism (e.g., in mapping onto the classical four humours), whereas in the Big Five, agreeableness is clearly the relevant cold / warm dimension, not neuroticism.  Furthermore, if we consider depression vs. anxiety as separable dimensions, depressed people may be more cold (along the agreeableness axis), while anxiety is clearly associated with the neuroticism axis.  But there is a strong *co-morbidity* between these two in terms of clinical diagnoses, as we'll see in the disorders chapter, so it can also be the case that these dimensions are linked in this way, potentially giving rise to these ambiguities.

Thus, it is critical to understand that while some of these dimensions may be correlated in certain sub-populations of people, across the broader population they do represent reasonably independent factors.  Some people can be low on neuroticism while also being low on agreeableness (i.e., gruff but emotionally calm, like Han Solo in Star Wars), while others are high on neuroticism but also low on agreeableness (anxious and depressed).

### Measures of Personality

Two of the developers of the Big Five factors, Paul Costa and Robert McCrae, originally developed the *NEO I*, which assessed Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness (I = inventory), and it was then revised to be the **NEO PI** (personality inventory) to include the full five factor model, and a subsequent revision has led to the *NEO PI-R*.  It has direct questions about behavior and thoughts, such as "I sometimes have wild ideas", with a typical 5-point **Likert** scale (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree).  The **test, retest reliability** is around 0.9 within 3 months, and over 6 years remains above 0.8 typically.

Because of the widely-accepted nature of the Big Five model, a wide range of interesting results are available.  For example, as one might expect, people become more agreeable and conscientious as they mature into adulthood, while the other factors actually tend to decrease.  Consistent with typical gender stereotypes, women score higher on Agreeableness, and Openness, but also Neuroticism compared to men.  There is a facet of Extraversion that captures Assertiveness, and men overall score higher on that compared to women.

In terms of various life outcomes, conscientiousness has been associated with higher longevity and academic performance, which is consistent with the marshmallow tests results overall.  Thus, while there are certainly important social situational factors that influence performance on the marshmallow task, these results do suggest that there are likely individual personality differences as well.

While the scientific world is exclusively focused on the Big Five, the venerable **Meyers Briggs Type Inventory** (MBTI) somehow still captures the public imagination to a much greater extent, perhaps because it is based off of the intuitively appealing ideas of Carl Jung.  In any case, the 4 different dimensions in the MBTI actually do correlate to some extent with the Big Five factors, especially (and obviously) the Extraversion / Intraversion dimension, which has the same name (it correlates at a 0.74 level).  The Sensing vs. Knowing (S-N) dimension of MBTI also maps well onto the Openness factor (0.72), while Thinking vs. Feeling (T-F) and Judging vs. Perceiving (J-P) are less strongly correlated with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, respectively (0.44 and 0.49).  The important Neuroticism factor is missing from MBTI.

While it is reassuring that the MBTI is measuring something that has been scientifically validated, it is nevertheless a very poor measure overall, in terms of the standard metrics such as test, retest reliability.  Thus, you are much better off taking the NEO PI-R than the MBTI!

## Group Dynamics

We conclude this chapter by considering psychology as it operates within the group itself, whereas the prior discussion has focused on the perspective of the individual within the group.  This shades into the domains of sociology, anthropology, and political science, and the field of **organizational psychology** which concerns the study of psychological principles within structured groups, like the work environment.

### In-Group / Out-Group

The most basic aspect of a group is *membership* -- who is in the group, and who is not?  We are all members of a diverse range of groups of various sizes, from family to nation to humanity.  Our membership in these groups forms a critical aspect of our individual identity.  People literally wear their group identities on their chests, in the form of T-shirts emblazoned with the logos of sports teams, colleges, and other such organizations.  More generally, the way that people dress indicates group membership and signals their identity to others.

The importance of group membership reflects our essential dependence on our *tribe*, in the evolution of our ancestors, and as reflected in all social animals, including social great apes, and tribal human cultures that remain to this day.  As we emphasized at the outset, we are fundamentally social organisms that depend entirely on others for our very survival, and this undoubtedly shapes our psychology at a very deep level, as has long been recognized by a number of theorists [@Sumner02; @Allport54; @Brewer99].

![**Figure 9.Y:** Chimpanzee groups exhibit sharing and affiliation within their in-group, and go to war against the out-group.](figures/fig_chimp_war.jpg){ width=50% }

Fundamentally, we exhibit **love** (warmth, agreeableness) toward those in our **in-group**, and in many (but certainly not all; [@Brewer99]) cases, **hate** toward those in the **out-group**.  In evolutionary terms, where the groups consisted mostly of family and tribe, we shared resources and depended upon our in-group, and fought wars with the out-group in the inevitable battle over resources.  This behavior has been observed in chimpanzee and gorilla groups (Figure 9.Y), and the deep-seated nature of this world view is undoubtedly behind our own blood-soaked past, which has featured nearly constant warfare and associated dehumanization of the out-group throughout recorded history.

When we are otherwise prevented from outright warfare, our minds nevertheless gravitate toward this polarizing perspective, as is evident in the extreme polarization of politics in modern societies.  The one thing that seems to bring people together within a country is rallying around a common foreign enemy (i.e., a commonly recognized out-group), and the absence of such a thing since the fall of the Soviet Union has undoubtedly contributed to the increase in polarization within the United States, for example.

A number of famous (or notorious as the case may be) psychology studies have demonstrated the power of these group dynamics, including the **Robbers Cave** [@SherifHarveyWhiteEtAl61] and **Stanford Prison Experiment** conducted by Phil Zimbardo.  Stanley Milgram's experiment induced ordinary people to administer extreme shocks to strangers, demonstrating the power of people in authority.

In the Robbers Cave study, two teams of boys at a summer camp exhibited classic polarized in-group / out-group dynamics (reminiscent of *Lord of the Flies*), including various acts of violence against each other, but further details about the experiments show that many of the events were encouraged and supported by the experimenters.  Likewise, the Stanford Prison experiment, which separated students into prisoners and guards and produced sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards, has been widely criticized for the explicit coaching of the guards.  Furthermore, its results have not been replicated across several attempts.

Thus, while it may not be so easy to replicate the most horrible of human behavior in a scientific study, there is nevertheless no doubt about the fundamental forces at work in the widespread evidence of this behavior in the world today, including widespread racism and prejudice, which is increasingly evident with the rise of authoritarian, nationalistic political movements around the world.

The noble goals behind these flawed experiments was to shine the bright light of science on the dark evolutionary wiring still in our brains, that causes us to think and act in ways that have little relevance in our modern, interconnected world where there is every potential for people to live together in relative harmony.  Perhaps if these biases were more widely recognized, it might help diffuse the power of such obvious abuse of our in-group / out-group biases in the world today.

### Stereotypes and Prejudice

The propensity to **stereotype** group members has long been recognized as a natural byproduct of our basic tendency to think in terms of simpler categories [@Allport54], as we have emphasized throughout in terms of the **compression** principle.  However, while stereotyping may be a natural cognitive process, when it interacts with out-group dynamics as discussed above, it leads to **prejudice** and the tendency to disrespect, dehumanize, and disenfranchise members of an out-group.

The development of a clever technique for revealing the presence of *implicit* stereotypes in the form of the **implicit association task** [@GreenwaldMcGheeSchwartz98] has led to the widespread recognition that negative stereotypes are so pervasive that they are even implicitly expressed by members of the relevant negatively stereotyped groups [@NosekSmythHansenEtAl07].  Thus, we now know that even when people think they are not "racist" at an explicit level, they almost certainly have encoded negative associations with various out-groups, which are almost inevitably going to lead to various kinds of negative outcomes for members of these groups.

At a very basic level, the internalization of these negative stereotypes can lead to reductions in self-esteem, which in turn can have cascading effects on perceived self efficacy, and thereby impact motivational and stress systems, producing widespread negative consequences on health, education, etc.  Thus, these negative stereotypes can become a form of *self-fulfilling prophesy*, known as **stereotype threat** [@Steele97], which directly impairs the performance of stigmatized individuals on tasks associated with these stigmas.  For example, the activation of the negative stereotype of women with respect to performance in traditional male-dominated fields such as physics and math has been shown to actively interfere with their performance on math tests [@SpencerSteeleQuinn99].

Remarkably, a relatively simple intervention involving the affirmation of individual values significantly improved women's performance in a college physics course [@MiyakeKost-SmithFinkelsteinEtAl10], suggesting that, by knowing about the potential for stereotype threat, such interventions can potentially help to break this vicious cycle.  Nevertheless, the layers of ingrained systemic inequality and racism that have built up over many years in most societies present significant barriers, requiring sustained efforts to overcome.

### Conformity, GroupThink, and Diffusion of Responsibility

Groups can influence the way people think in other ways beyond the fundamental in-group / out-group dynamics.  One of the most important findings here is the extent to which the everpresent social pressure captured in the cold / warm and *Agreeableness* factors discussed above causes people to **conform** to the group in ways that they are typically unaware of.  

For example, Solomon Asch conducted a famous experiment where groups of 8 male college students made judgments about which line matched a reference line, where the answer was obvious, but 7 out of the 8 students were confederates in the experiment, and they made obviously wrong choices on 12 out of 18 total trials.  All of the confederates responded first, and the critical question was: what kind of response would one true subject of the experiment make after hearing everyone else make an obviously wrong choice?  Remarkably, roughly 37% of responses conformed to the confederates wrong choice!  This is a surprisingly large number, but it is also important to emphasize that subsequent interviews revealed that most subjects were suspicious of the experiment and knew that the others were making wrong responses, and that 95% of subjects defied the majority at least once.

Nevertheless, even if people's underlying perceptions were not changed, the strong pressure to conform in overt behavior serves as an important indication of the nature of these social forces.  This kind of strong social force may explain the otherwise puzzling reactions of loyal members of political groups to news stories that would otherwise seem to undermine core group beliefs.  The ability to deny facts that are just as glaringly obvious as those in Asch's study has continuously stunned observers in the United States --- this is real-world data demonstrating that Asch's conclusions were not incorrect or even overstated.

The power of conformity also manifests in the phenomenon of **Groupthink**, which was popularized by Irving Janis' analysis of the Bay of Pigs disaster [@Janis72], demonstrating how individuals ceeded their own judgement in favor of the prevailing group opinions, and engaged in self-censorship and failure to raise objections and alternative perspectives that they were fully aware of.  The presence of a strong and biased leadership is also a major risk factor in promoting groupthink, consistent with the fundamental dynamics of dominance and submission in social interactions.

Another widely discussed phenomenon in group cognition is the **bystander effect** or **diffusion of responsibility**, where individuals assume someone else in the group will take responsibility for a situation.  This reflects a fundamental uncertainty about distribution of roles in groups, and is why highly-organized, hierarchical systems are generally much more effective in coordinating activity in larger groups.  In such organizations, such as the military, there is a clear chain of command, and each individual has a clear set of responsibilities and duties.  By contrast, more amorphous groups with unclear structure and division of labor create considerable ambiguity in whether an individual should assume a more dominant or submissive role within the group, with implications for acting "out of line" -- often the least risky behavior is to do nothing.

The "textbook" example of this phenomenon is the murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City, where the initial media report indicated that many people heard her screams but nobody called the police.  However, as with most of these famous textbook cases that we've been reviewing here, the truth is somewhat different: in fact several people did call the police, but the police were very slow to respond.  Nevertheless, the diffusion of responsibility story is so compelling given our many uncomfortable experiences of such things, that everyone unquestioningly believed the inaccurate initial media report.

### Cultural Differences

Finally, there is an increasing body of research investigating the many differences in cultures around the world, and how these affect the way individuals in those cultures think and behave [@NisbettMasuda03].  One of the most widely discussed cases concerns the large differences across cultures in the conception of the individual in relation to the larger society. In many western cultures, especially the USA, there is a strongly individualistic tradition that emphasizes the individual as free and independent from the larger society, while in many eastern cultures, there is a more collectivist view of the individual as an integral part of the group, not something apart from it.  For example, in Japan, there is a widespread saying that "the nail that stands out gets hammered down", and Japanese people are reluctant in general to emphasize their individuality, with modesty about abilities being especially important.

## Summary of Key Terms

This is a checklist of key terms / concepts that you should know about from this chapter.  As we'll learn in the memory chapter, it is a great idea to test yourself on what was said about each of these terms, and then go back and double-check --- that provides both beneficial repetition and also the *testing effect*.
