Language is like water to a fish.  It is everywhere, and, as a result, we can often end up taking it for granted.  Indeed, it is right here, right now, at every moment of this text as I'm writing it and you are reading it.  It is unfolding right before your eyes, and somehow dribbling out of my fingers as I type these words.  Without it, we would truly be nowhere.  At least, certainly not *here*.

The full scope of language is unique to humans, although other animals certainly communicate in a variety of ways, and because we aren't native speakers of those languages, there remains some doubt that we might be underestimating their expressive power.  Over the first few years of life, we somehow naturally soak up and master language, in ways that adults remain jealous of when they try to learn a new one --- it is only then that we truly start to appreciate the incredible complexity of language (or when you try to read about it in a textbook like this)!  This natural affinity for learning language has led many to believe that the brain comes pre-wired with a kind of proto-language module built right in, while others have examined the remarkable learning abilities of infants and toddlers and concluded that language learning from a kind of blank slate can explain everything.  As usual, the truth is likely somewhere between these *nature* vs. *nurture* extremes, as we'll revisit in [@sec:ch-origins].

Once we have acquired language, how does it change our brains?  How would a human brain function *without* language?  These fascinating questions are almost impossible to answer precisely, but there are a number of remarkable examples of children raised by wolves and other rather more horrible circumstances that provide some insight.  Furthermore, it is perhaps not unreasonable to use our closest great ape species as points of comparison for organisms in their natural environment with highly similar brains, but without our capacity for language.  From that standpoint, it is clear that language is enabling just about everything that makes us unique among all the animals --- chimps and gorillas are pretty amazing, but they aren't flying airplanes, are they!

For that matter, however, neither were we until a little over 100 years ago, and looking back, there is clearly some kind of exponentially accelerating process, going from the earliest societies with recorded histories several thousand years ago, to the breakneck speed of progress in the present day.  It is not a coincidence that the pace of progress seems to be correlated with technological developments that enable faster and more efficient forms of communication, among ever-larger groups of people.  In short, the airplane and today's proliferation of rocket ships are really fueled by the progression of communication technologies, starting with the printing press in 1440, and continuing from there, with the telegraph, telephone, radio, television, internet, and cell phone each providing qualitative advances in our ability to communicate.  Together with the development of computer technology from the 1960's onward, we are witnessing the fundamental importance and power of *information* and *communication*.

Just in my lifetime, I witnessed the development of most of these more recent advances.  When I was was a kid in the early 1970's, my sister and I would watch *Gilligan's Island* on a color TV with no remote control (we had to get off the couch to change the channel, and there were only 3-4 channels anyway, so it wasn't that big of a deal), and we would read newspapers and magazines that delivered information updated at most once per day.  By the time I was in middle school, I took a class on computer programming, using the brand new Apple II computer, saving programs on floppy disks, or printing things out on a huge printer.  I had a progression of computers through middle school, high school, and college, none of which were connected to the internet (which was only available in the military and universities).  Finally, in graduate school starting in 1990 I used computers connected to the internet, and discovered the world of email and the *usenet* newsgroups.  I remember exactly the day in 1993 that a programmer working with me first pulled up a web browser and connected to the world-wide-web: we looked at a webcam of a coffee pot in Hawaii, and I thought it all seemed pretty silly.  I never really thought of a computer as a communication device, and spent most of my time writing my own programs to simulate the brain.

As we will revisit in [@sec:ch-soc], we always seem to underestimate the importance of our social and cultural environment in shaping and enabling our individual abilities.  We are only conscious of our internal mental state, which is uniquely ours, and all that other stuff out always seems peripheral.  But soon enough, that silly internet became an incredible timesaver: I no longer had to go to the library to look up scientific articles.  I could google (I was an early google adopter, which I thought was cool because they used Linux) information that helped me write programs faster, and download software directly from the internet instead of waiting for a disk to be snail-mailed to me.  It is impossible for people who grew up with the internet and always-connected cell phones to appreciate how *slow* and *inconvenient* communication was in the "olden days".  And I of course could not imagine how people used to depend on horses and even foot travel to deliver hand-written messages on paper, or just by word of mouth.

In short, the pace of progress is directly proportional to the pace of communication, which has increased exponentially, and this all goes back to the importance of language, without which we are unable to communicate.  One of the most important features of language and communication more generally is the need to adopt *standards* or *conventions* --- despite our strong individualistic tendencies, we all must work together to agree upon a standard of communication, whether that is in terms of the words we use, or the adoption of standard protocols such as the internet itself, or HTML and other standards built on top of it. The biblical story of the *Tower of Babel* speaks to the importance of a shared language, and the fundamental confusion that arises when confronting people who speak a different language.  The bible also provides a testament to the central importance of language in defining cultural identity, inevitably creating a conflict between the desire to share and communicate across ever broader groups of people, and the opposite desire to build a unique identity and culture that has special meaning among a "chosen people".

In the modern world, we have a tension where English has emerged as the *de facto* standard language across the world, which has enabled these amazing advances in sharing information (e.g., all important scientific papers are written in English), but many cultures are simultaneously working to reestablish their own native languages as a way of preserving their own unique cultural identity and history.  Furthermore, somewhat ironically (and perhaps tragically), the technological advances built upon the standard computer communication protocols have enabled the current trend toward increasingly polarized, insular, and "dissociated" groups on the internet, which have created their own separate standards for what is true and accepted as fact.  This is a direct manifestation of the fundamental tension between the individual and the larger society, and the desire to create special *in-groups* that reinforce our need for *control* and power --- we need to establish *contrasts* between ourselves and others.  Thus, the fundamental influence of the 3 C's is ever-present (language itself is all about *compression* as well), and language is one battle ground on which all of this plays out in dramatic fashion.

One final question that is interesting to ponder in this context: have we reached some kind of maximum level of communication technology at this point, or are there obvious qualitative ways in which our ability to communicate could be improved yet further?  Certainly there always seems to be room for further improvements in the speed and reliability of the raw communication channels, but we now have complete portability and sufficient bandwidth to support immediate, bidirectional information exchange.  


In the remainder of this chapter, we first discuss the basic elements of language, from speech to writing and syntax and semantics, and then investigate the nature of language acquisition, for both first and second languages.  Then, we explore the relationships between language and thought, including the power of language in enabling our cognitive abilities, driving the intellectual and technological advances highlighted above.
