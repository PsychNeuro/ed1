# Chapter 2: Neuroscience

From a materialist, neuroscientific perspective, *everything* that happens in your mind is due to underlying physical processes taking place in your brain.  As we discussed in the last chapter, this does *not* mean that we can *reduce* your mind to the brain, but it does mean that there is a really huge mystery here: how is it even remotely possible for a physical system to produce the amazing subjective delights (and terrors, and everything in between) that we all experience?

We start by tackling this first question, using a deceptively simple case that illustrates the fundamental principle of **emergence** (Figure 2.1).  As elaborated in the caption, there is something just slightly magical that emerges out of the interaction between two gears, which cannot be reduced directly to either gear separately.  It depends critically and essentially on the relationship and interaction between the two different parts.  Furthermore, the actual material that the gears are made of is largely irrelevant, as long as it is reasonably solid.  Thus, there truly is some kind of seemingly mysterious new "substance" being created out of this interaction, which can "transcend" its material basis.  And yet, it nevertheless depends entirely and directly on having an actual material basis.  The *drawing* of those gears doesn't work at all like two actual gears -- even if they were made of very stiff paper or cardboard.


![Fig 2-1: The principle of *emergence*, simply illustrated.  The gears on the left do not interact, and nothing interesting happens.  However, on the right, the interaction between the gears produces interesting, useful phenomena that *cannot* be reduced to the individual gears *separately*.  For example, the little gear will spin faster, but the larger one will have higher torque at its axel -- these properties would be entirely different if either gear interacted with different sized gear.  Furthermore, the material that the gear is made from really doesn't matter very much -- the same basic behavior would be produced by plastic, metal, wood, etc.  Thus, even in this simple case, there is something just slightly magical and irreducible going on -- when two gears get together, something emerges that is more than the sum of the parts, and exists in a way independent of the parts, even while being entirely dependent on actually *having* those parts to make it happen.  This seems like a good analogy for the relationship between the mind and the brain.](figures/fig_gears.png)

This captures the strange relationship between mind and brain, in a system so simple that truly there can be no hidden magic taking place.  Mind depends entirely on brain, and yet it fully transcends it.  As we'll see in a moment, the brain has billions of tiny, interacting parts (*neurons*), which, like the gears, interact in ways that produce emergent properties transcending their material substance.  Moreover, there are so many neurons in the brain, and each one interacts with so many *other* neurons (receiving roughly 10,000 inputs and sending a similar number of outputs), that there is a vastly greater degree of emergent interactions taking place in the brain compared to our simple gear example.  Thus, although it is essentially impossible for us to wrap our own minds around it, it should be possible to at least imagine in a vague way how something as fantastic and complex as the mind could indeed emerge out of all those billions and billions of interactions taking place every nanosecond, right inside your very own brain.

To try out another metaphor, you can also think about the brain as a massive LEGO set, with parts that *learn* to interconnect with each other in myriad ways.  As you might have experienced in your youth, the number of different ways even a small pile of LEGO's can be combined to make different things quickly exhausts the imagination.  This *combinatorial explosion* of possibilities is an essential feature of the brain -- our neurons can be interconnected in so unimaginably many different ways, that the possibilities are truly effectively infinite.  Due to this explosive nature of combinations, even small numbers of elements can be combined in more different ways than there are atoms in the universe!  For fun, type in `69!` (factorial) on your calculator, and you'll get a number that is 1.7... with 98 zeros!  This factorial function lies at the heart of combinatorial explosion, and gives a rough sense of the number of different combinations of 69 parts.  You can't even begin to conceive of (or even calculate) the value of 100,000,000,000! (i.e., the factorial of the 100 billion neurons in your brain).

## Simple Neurons Make Complex Work

One of the secrets of LEGO is that all the different parts interconnect using a single, simple principle, so that you really can make all those different combinations work.  The same is true of the brain: each neuron operates according to surprisingly simple, easily-understood principles, and the power emerges through all the interactions / combinations of these simple parts.  For full disclosure, not everyone agrees with this perspective, and many scientists have spent a long time exploring more complex kinds of languages that neurons might speak, but that is a topic for a more advanced textbook.  Through the use of computer models of neurons, we can at least say with confidence that the simple ideas presented here can account for a surprisingly large amount of what we know about brain function.

![Fig 2-2: The neuron as a detector.  Inputs come in via *synapses* connecting the *axons* of other neurons to the *dendrites* of a given neuron.  This neuron *integrates* these inputs , resulting in an overall *electrical potential* (called the *membrane potential*, because it is the electrical difference between the inside and outside of the neuron's cell membrane), in the cell body.  At the start of the axon (the axon *hillock*), a critical *go / nogo* "decision" is made -- if the membrane potential is sufficiently elevated, then the neuron triggers an *action potential* (aka a "spike"), which races up the axon and delivers its signal to the many thousands of other neurons that are "listening" to this signal, via their own synaptic connections.  Thus, the essence of neural function is *communciation* -- neurons are highly social little things, and our brain is really a huge social network of chattering naybobs.](figures/fig_neuron_as_detect.png)

The easiest way to understand what neurons are doing is in terms of **detection** (Figure 2-2).  A neuron acts much like a smoke detector, constantly sampling its local environment (i.e., its inputs from other neurons), and looking for some set of important signals that indicate that something *important* might be going on (e.g., a fire in the case of the smoke detector).  Each of the important biological parts of the neuron take on a clear functional role within this overall detector model:

* __Synapses__: are the tiny gaps between neurons, where the "output" signals from one neuron cross over and become the "input" signals to the next.  Most synapses are *chemical*, involving the release of a *neurotransmitter* from the *presynaptic* axons, which then bind to *receptors* on the *postsynaptic* dendrites.  These receptors twist open as a result of neurotransmitter binding, and allow *ions* (i.e., electrical charge) to flow into the dendrites.  The most common neurotransmitter in the neocortex is *glutamate*, and it opens up channels called *AMPA* channels, that allow sodium (Na+) ions to flow into the dendrites, thus creating a *positive* electrical potential in the receiving neuron.  All this complex-sounding machinery and terminology is actually very simple: Neurons like to excite other neurons by sending them exciting signals!  The basic machinery is chemical and electrical, but the bottom line is just: how strongly do the input signals to a given neuron excite it?  This is determined by the detailed function of each of the roughly 10,000 synapses coming into a given neuron.

![Fig 2-3: The neuron as a *funnel*, *compressing* its 10,000-odd inputs down into a *single* output signal, conveyed through its axonal output.  This is the genesis of the *Compression* principle of brain function.](figures/fig_neuron_as_funnel.png)

* __Dendrites__: provide a broad tree-like (dendrite literally means tree-like) "arbor" for all the synaptic inputs into a neuron, and they funnel the resulting electrical charges up into the cell body.  This funnel-like property, illustrated in Figure 2-3, is the origin of the **compression** principle of brain function, one of our three C's.  As we noted in the introduction, each neuron is compressing its 10,000 different inputs into a single output signal, which it then *broadcasts* to roughly 10,000 other neurons.  Critically, this really is a broadcast-like operation -- there is no way for it to customize its message for different subsets of listening neurons.  Thus, there really is a 10,000-to-1 compression factor taking place at each neuron.  As an aside, one of the big debates in neuroscience is the extent to which these dendrites perform various kinds of more complex "processing" of their synaptic inputs, or simply convey the overall signal.  There is evidence on both sides, and, as usual, the truth is likely somewhere in between.

* __Cell Body__: The neuron is a cell, and, despite its long tendrils, has a cell body like other more compact kinds of cells, where the nucleus and other cellular machinery hangs out.  It is here that all the dendritic signals converge, to produce the final compressed electrical potential that somehow summarizes everything coming into the cell at that moment.  This electrical potential is called the *membrane potential* because the electrical signal is measured as a difference in electrical potential across the cell's membrane (that fatty lipid bilayer that you might recall reading about in high school science).  If this membrane potential is sufficiently excited, then special channels at the start of the axon (the axon *hillock*) will get *extra* excited and essentially flip a switch, causing the initiation of the *action potential* or *spike*.

* __Axon__: The spike propagates down the axon, continuing the great chain of communciation among neurons.  Axons can have varying amounts of *myelin*, provided by helpful *glia* cells called *oligodendrocytes* (no you won't be tested on those!), which serve to insulate the electrical "wire" that is the axon.  Myelinated axons convey information more quickly, and *multiple sclerosis* is one of various disorders that involves the degeneration of this myelin, resulting in slowed signal conduction.

To summarize, each neuron is receiving a huge amount of input through its roughly 10,000 synapses, and it then compresses this all down into a single discrete spiking signal that it then broadcasts back out to the roughly 10,000 other neurons listening to its little story.  Only when a neuron detects something "interesting" does it get excited enough to send this spiky signal out.  This is *thresholding* is just as important in neurons as it is in people: it can rapidly get tiresome to listen to someone with a *low threshold* who is always blabbering on about the most uninteresting things.  The advent of Facebook and other forms of social media has only exacerbated this problem (which indeed did exist prior to such modern tech, as I can personally attest).

![Fig 2-4: Details of the communication process across the synapse between a sending axon and a receiving dendrite.  Neurotransmitter is released from the *terminal button* (pronounced in French-style by those in the know), and opens corresponding *receptors* on the dendrites, allowing electrically-charged *ions* to flow into the receiving neuron.](figures/fig_synapse.png)

We'll explore more about what kinds of interesting conversations neurons might be having, but first let's try to understand in just a bit more depth about how this electrical magic operates within the neuron.  The details of this are typically not presented at this introductory level, but a really simple analogy helps make it accessible, and this machinery ends up producing the **contrast** effects that are so central to our overall framework, so we're motivated to take this brief detour.

## The Tug-of-War in Your Brain

There are actually two major classes of synaptic inputs converging on each neuron: the excitatory ones described above (via the neurotransmitter glutamate opening AMPA receptors), and separate *inhibitory* synaptic inputs that are driven by a neurotransmitter called *GABA* which activates... *GABA* receptors!  These inhibitory inputs come from an entirely separate set of specialized neurons known as *inhibitory interneurons*, which are somewhat more like *glia* in overall status within the pecking-order of the brain.  These interneurons only act relatively locally, like glia, and they also play a largely *regulatory* role, regulating the overall level of electrical excitation surging through the brain.  In contrast, the main excitatory neurons (which constitute roughly 85% of neurons in the neocortex) can broadcast their exciting messages over long distances to far-flung regions of the brain, and are regarded as the primary *information processing* neurons (i.e., they are primarily responsible for all the chatter and compression going on).

![Fig 2-5: The Tug-of-War between excitation and inhibition, producing a beneficial balancing act, and the source of **contrast** coding in the brain.  Inhibition pulls the membrane potential (written as Vm, where V=voltage and m=membrane), down toward the *resting potential* of roughly -75 mV, while excitation pulls up toward roughly 0 to +55 mV (depending on type of neuron, etc).  Theta represents the *threshold* electrical potential, above which the neuron will fire a spike.  The ability to do so depends only on the *relative* balance between excitation and inhibition, not the absolute levels.  ](figures/fig_vm_as_tug_of_war.png)

Inside each neuron, excitation and inhibition are forever locked in a pitched battle, which can be pictured as a tug-of-war, with each side pulling with varying strength, but always in the same direction (Figure 2-5).  The "pitch" on which this battle is taking place is the amount of electrical charge in the cell, i.e., the membrane potential.  The excitatory end is always pulling this potential upwards, while the inhibitory side is pulling it back down, and the actual potential represents the balance between these two forces.

The essential, critical point here is that **contrast**, or **relativity** emerges as the result of this tug-of-war battle.  Specifically, it doesn't matter how strong the two different sides on the tug-of-war are in absolute terms -- all that matters is the *relative* strength of the two sides.  Excitation could be relatively weak, but if inhibition is also week, then the net balance between the two will be the same as if each was proportionally stronger.

Typically, the amount of inhibition is roughly proportional to the "average" amount of activity in the brain in any given area, so in effect, each neuron is effectively comparing how excited it is agains this overall "average" level.  Only those neurons that are getting *above average* level of excitation will actually get excited enough to fire spikes.

In real-world terms, this "average" inhibition is very much like the amount of money that your peers are making (or the amount of fun they appear to be having on their various social media accounts) -- it forms the baseline or standard against which you measure yourself.  Likewise, neurons are constantly comparing themselves against *their* peers, and all of the spiking going on in your brain is therefore always and inexorably *relative* to these peer-standards.  For example, when you step outside into the bright sunlight, all the visual neurons suddenly get a huge wave of excitation relative to the dim indoor light from before.  But you avoid suffering an epileptic seizure from all that excitement because those inhibitory interneurons are also getting this wave of excitation, causing them to send a proportional amount of damping inhibition on the party, keeping everyone in balance and on a more level keel.  Yes, inhibition is the wet rag of the brain, but without it, you really would be suffering from seizures all the time.

In fact, this balancing act between excitation and inhibition is so important for overall brain function, that our brains are perched on a kind of "knife edge", and the relatively high incidence of epilepsy in the population is likely a result of the fact that it is really hard to get this balance exactly right.  And too much inhibition has very bad consequences as well (indeed, it literally "depresses" your brain and makes it difficult for you to do anything).  Furthermore, the main treatments for epilepsy involve activating the GABA inhibitory system more strongly, thus altering this fundamental tug-of-war balance.

In summary, two out of the three of the core principles of this textbook, **compression** and **contrast**, emerge directly out of the basic function of neurons.  As we discussed in the Introduction, we can trace the implications of these core neural properties all the way through the full scope of Psychology and behavior.  The next chapter will provide particularly compelling demonstrations of how compression and contrast play out in our perceptual lives -- the story of perception really is fundamentally the story of compression and contrast.

By thinking in these terms, we have managed to dramatically simplfy our understanding of the brain, creating an almost transparent, level-spanning way of going from single neurons on up.  However, none of this contradicts the emergence and complexity discussed at the outset.  Instead, these principles just capture the overall general tendencies and propensities of the brain, but within that broader scope, there is a wild, complex, bubbling jungle of intertwined conversations and chatter constantly unfolding within your brain, thinking all manner of complex and ineffable thoughts.  Next, we'll move up from the level of individual neurons and start to think about how all these principles might play out in terms of how different brain areas are organized to facilitate effective overall behavior and cognition.

## Large-Scale Brain Organization ("Gross" Anatomy)

"All politics is local" is as true for the brain as it is for people, perhaps more so: neurons can't pack-up and leave.  They are like the 85% of Pittsburghers, living their entire lives in the same little neighborhoods.  This creates the possibility of *specialization of neural function* -- different neighborhoods can develop their own special "personalities" and focus on detecting particular kinds of signals.  On the other hand, the excitatory neurons in the brain also send out long-range connections.  Network theorists characterize these as "small world" patterns of connectivity, such that, in the end, every neuron is only a few synapses away from every other neuron.  This then limits how much "neighborhood funkiness" can develop.

Historically, there was a classic debate between Karl Lashley and ?? about this question of specialization of function, with Lashley showing that he could lesion large amounts of just about anywhere in the rat brain, and produce similar-looking behavioral effects.  However, it turns out that he was using very simple behavioral tests, and when you push those poor brain damaged rats harder, they actually do fail in different ways with different types of brain damage.  But not perfectly, systematically so.  Again, the truth is always somewhere in the middle of such debates.
