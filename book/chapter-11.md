# Chapter 11: Disorders and Therapy

John Glenn's quote about how he felt before taking off in the rocket *Friendship 7* in 1962:

> *I felt exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you were sitting on top of 2 million parts --- all built by the lowest bidder on a government contract.*

reflects how we might feel about the incidence of mental disorders in people.  We're all sitting on top of a brains made of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, all built by itself.  *What could possibly go wrong!?*

The fact that our brains so routinely self-organize into highly functional beings is one of the greatest miracles of the natural world.  But, alas, things can, and do, go awry.  At any given time, roughly 20% of the US population is suffering from a mental illness according to the [NIH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/index.shtml), and over the lifetime, an estimated 30% will suffer from anxiety disorders, and more than 20% will suffer from major depression.  These are astounding statistics, and our task here is to understand how and why things can go wrong, and what ways we have to try to help people suffering from these disorders.

There are many important and challenging issues to confront here.

First, to what extent are mental disorders based on *biology,* like other diseases that might afflict other parts of our body?  This **disease model** is appealingly simple --- find the biological source and deliver some kind of drug or other treatment to fix it, and send people on their merry way!  But despite all the recent hype about **Prozac** and other "miracle drugs", it is becoming increasingly clear that the most prevalent disorders, depression and anxiety, are *not* due to a simple "chemical imbalance" in the brain, and that **therapy** is likely the best treatment for all but the most severe cases.

On the other hand, rarer and more severe forms of mental disorders such as *schizophrenia* almost certainly do have at least a partial biological basis (and are partially genetically heritable), but we now know that schizophrenia is a very diverse disorder with many distinct causes (*etiologies*), and despite massive efforts by many people over many years, it remains incompletely treated by available drugs and therapies.  Then there are the clear cases of biologically-based diseases, such as *Parkinson's disease*, where the precise neural basis of the disease is known.

To understand these basic facts, we need to recognize that the brain is not like a car or other mechanical device, where discrete parts break and give rise to clear symptoms, and have clear fixes.  Instead, as we've emphasized throughout, the brain is an unbelievably complex emergent system, and the ways in which it goes wrong are also complex and emergent.  Furthermore, we have to appreciate that *we have someone on the inside* who can tell us some important things about what is going on inside that incredibly complex system, and, critically, that special someone can actually do things to *fix the system from the inside out.*  This is the core premise of therapy, and the undeniable efficacy of modern, empirically-supported theraputic techniques clearly indicates that we do in fact have the ability to fix ourselves (to some extent at least).

Another challenging question that comes up, especially in some disorders such as autism, is the extent to which we should even be using the term *disorder* to refer to the condition, with phrases such as "differently abled" being preferred by some.  Thus, we have to be careful to recognize that our practical definitions of what counts as a disorder are always relative to some statistical, conventional definition of "normal", and that such definitions are subject to change over time.  For example, homosexuality was once officially recognized as a disorder, but now it is not.

And even if there is some agreement that a particular type of disorder deserves the label as such, *where do you draw the line* between "normal" and "disordered"?  And how many such lines are there -- how do we categorize the set of such disorders in some kind of systematic, effective way that helps us actually understand and treat these disorders?  Although it is significantly less so now, mental disorders have typically carried a **stigma** associated with them, and thus there are potential costs associated with labeling someone as having a disorder.  On the other hand, such labels are essential for the medical community to organize treatment, including everything from insurance coverage to nature of treatment, etc.

We can understand why mental disorders have a stigma in a way that other health disorders do not --- brain function is inexorably tied to the subjective inner *self* in a way that liver function just isn't.  When something goes wrong in your brain, you are right there with it, and others tend to wonder both what kind of causal role you might have in bringing about the disorder in the first place, and also why you can't just fix it on your own.  This goes back to the issues of self-control that we discussed in the previous chapter. Fortunately, awareness of the prevalence and nature of these disorders is helping to mitigate these stigmas, and making it easier for people to seek help when they need it.

TODO: Attractor figure

One of the main ideas we'll explore below is that there may be a **common failure mode** in the complex, emergent dynamics of the brain, that can be triggered by a wide range of different biological and psychological causes, all of which lead to a kind of **attractor state** in the system (Figure X).  This attractor state is defined by a **vicious cycle** of negative affect (fear and depression) that short-circuits the motivational and cognitive control systems in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, which in turn leads to more negative affect due to a reduced level of self-esteem, perceived self-efficacy, and general feelings of loss of control and motivation to function.  The essential role of self-control and self-efficacy in the human motivational system was discussed in the previous chapter and also Chapter 5, which should make clear that dysfunction in these core systems can really bring the whole self-model down.  This framework then helps us understand how and why therapy can help: the most effective therapies directly target these core systems of self-control and self-efficacy, and by essentially "rebooting" these systems, they help break the vicious cycle and propel people back out of this bad attractor state, and into a more positive **virtuous cycle** where feelings of self-efficacy give rise to motivated thoughts and behaviors that result in sustained and enhanced feelings of self-efficacy.


## Psychiatry, Psychology, Neurology

The ambiguity between the *medical* and *psychological* nature of mental disorders is also captured in the professions that typically treat these disorders.  A **psychiatrist** is a medical doctor (MD) who has special training in dealing with mental disorders, and is licensed to prescribe drugs to treat disorders.  A **clinical psychologist** is an individual trained in various forms of therapy, typically with a Masters or PhD level degree, along with relevant state professional certification.  A **neurologist** is an MD who has more specialized training in direct brain-level interventions such as neurosurgery --- they are typically involved in diagnosing and treating more clearly biologically-based diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Then you have people like me, who are non-clinical psychologists with PhD's who just try to figure out how the brain works, but aren't licensed or really able to help anyone with their particular disorders.  When I sit next to someone on the airplane, I always say I'm a "cognitive neuroscientist" because then they don't get uncomfortable and think I'm analyzing them, or ask me to diagnose them or something awkward like that.  Inevitably, they end up referring to me as a "neurologist" later, but whatever.
