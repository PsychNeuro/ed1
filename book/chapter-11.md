# Chapter 11: Disorders and Therapy

John Glenn's quote about how he felt before taking off in the rocket *Friendship 7* in 1962:

> *I felt exactly how you would feel if you were getting ready to launch and knew you were sitting on top of 2 million parts --- all built by the lowest bidder on a government contract.*

reflects how we might feel about the incidence of mental disorders in people.  We're all sitting on top of a brains made of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, all built by itself.  *What could possibly go wrong!?*

The fact that our brains so routinely self-organize into highly functional beings is one of the greatest miracles of the natural world.  But, alas, things can, and do, go awry.  At any given time, roughly 20% of the US population is suffering from a mental illness according to the [NIH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/index.shtml), and over the lifetime, an estimated 30% will suffer from anxiety disorders, and more than 20% will suffer from major depression.  These are astounding statistics, and our task here is to understand how and why things can go wrong, and what ways we have to try to help people suffering from these disorders.

There are many important and challenging issues to confront here.

First, to what extent are mental disorders based on *biology,* like other diseases that might afflict other parts of our body?  This **disease model** is appealingly simple --- find the biological source and deliver some kind of drug or other treatment to fix it, and send people on their merry way!  But despite all the recent hype about **Prozac** and other "miracle drugs", it is becoming increasingly clear that the most prevalent disorders, depression and anxiety, are *not* due to a simple "chemical imbalance" in the brain for most people, and that **therapy** is likely the best treatment for all but the most severe cases.

On the other hand, rarer and more severe forms of mental disorders such as *schizophrenia* almost certainly do have at least a partial biological basis (and are partially genetically heritable), but we now know that schizophrenia is a very diverse disorder with many distinct causes (**etiologies**), and despite massive efforts by many people over many years, it remains incompletely treated by available drugs and therapies.  Then there are the clear cases of biologically-based diseases, such as *Parkinson's disease*, where the precise neural basis of the disease is known, and biologically-based treatments are the medical standard of care.

Another challenging question that is especially pressing in some disorders such as *autism*, which encompass a huge range of different degrees and symptoms, is the extent to which we should even be using the term *disorder*?  Is it better to think instead in terms of **neurodiversity** --- just different ways that the brain can function?  For high-functioning individuals with autism, this seems like a reasonable argument, but what about those with severe disabilities in terms of language, cognitive function, and basic tasks of daily living?  In short, we have to be careful to recognize that our practical definitions of what counts as a disorder are always relative to some statistical, conventional definition of "normal" or **neurotypical**, and that such definitions are subject to change over time.  For example, homosexuality was once officially recognized as a disorder, but now it is not.

And even if there is some agreement that a particular type of disorder deserves the label as such, *where do you draw the line* between "normal" and "disordered"?  And how many such lines are there -- how do we categorize the set of such disorders in some kind of systematic, effective way that helps us actually understand and treat these disorders?  Although significantly less so now, mental disorders have typically carried a **stigma** associated with them, and thus there are potential costs associated with labeling someone as having a disorder.  On the other hand, such labels are essential for the medical community to organize treatment, including everything from insurance coverage to nature of treatment, etc.

We can understand why mental disorders have a stigma in a way that other health disorders do not --- brain function is inexorably tied to the subjective inner *self* in a way that liver function just isn't.  When something goes wrong in your brain, you are right there with it, and others tend to wonder what kind of causal role you might have in bringing about the disorder in the first place, and also why you can't just fix it on your own.  This goes back to the issues of self-control that we discussed in Chapter 9. Fortunately, awareness of the prevalence and nature of these disorders is helping to mitigate these stigmas, and making it easier for people to seek help when they need it.

![**Figure 11.1:** Attractor (network) model explanation of the comorbidity across many disorders.  Each disorder has a different starting point (etiology) but due to the vicious cycle nature of certain symptoms and states, they can be "attracted" to a common overall state.  A wide basin of attraction implies many different such starting states can be drawn into the same attractor, which can explain why even in more biologically-based disorders such schizophrenia, there can be a huge number of different genetic risk factors.  It also explains how environmental factors can interact with biological factors in complex ways, by pushing these attractor dynamics around.](figures/fig_disorders_attractor.png){ width=40% }

To understand why the disease model does not apply in many cases, we need to recognize that the brain is not like a car or other mechanical device, where discrete parts break and give rise to clear symptoms, and have clear fixes.  Instead, as we've emphasized throughout, the brain is an unbelievably complex emergent system, and the ways in which it goes wrong are also complex and emergent.  This perspective is captured in the increasingly popular **network model** of mental disorders [@CramerWaldorpvanderMaasEtAl10; @Borsboom17], which explains how a wide range of different biological and psychological causes can all lead to a kind of **attractor state** in the system (Figure 11.1).

A particularly important signature of this kind of attractor state is the high level of **comorbidity** across different disease categories and etiologies --- despite these different starting points and apparent biological causes, there is a relatively high probability of people being classified as having multiple disorders.  Depression and anxiety, which are the two most prevalent disorders, are also the most likely to be *comorbid* (co-occurring) with other disorders, and with each other.  Furthermore, most of the disorders involve the same major brain areas, including the **prefrontal cortex**, **basal ganglia**, **amygdala**, and **midbrain dopamine** systems, which you hopefully recognize as the major components of the cognitive and self control system, including especially the ventral and medial "limbic" areas of frontal cortex (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) that are involved in affective and motivational processing and control.

Putting all of this together, the attractor state typically corresponds to a **vicious cycle** of negative affect (fear and depression) that short-circuits the motivational and cognitive control systems in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, which in turn leads to more negative affect due to a reduced level of self-esteem, perceived self-efficacy, and general feelings of loss of control and motivation to function.  The essential role of self-control and self-efficacy in the human motivational system was discussed in Chapters 9 and 5 --- from this basis, it should be clear that dysfunction in these core systems can really bring the whole self-model down.

This framework also helps us understand how and why therapy can help: the most effective therapies directly target these core systems of self-control and self-efficacy, and by essentially "rebooting" these systems, they help break the vicious cycle and propel people back out of this bad attractor state, and into a more positive **virtuous cycle** where feelings of self-efficacy give rise to motivated thoughts and behaviors that result in sustained and enhanced feelings of self-efficacy.  Consistent with this understanding, **behavioral activation** is the most effective element of the most effective form of therapy for treating depression [@DimidjianMartellHerman-DunnEtAl14], and these issues of perceived self-control and self-efficacy are reliable precursors for depressive episodes [@IacovielloAlloyAbramsonEtAl10].

Although the close proximity of the *self* and mental disorders can be a source of stigma, it is also critical to appreciate that *we have someone on the inside* who can tell us some important things about what is going on in the maelstrom of this complex system.  That special someone can actually do things to *fix the system from the inside out.*  This is the core premise of therapy, and the undeniable efficacy of modern, empirically-supported theraputic techniques clearly indicates that we do in fact have some (albeit imperfect) ability to fix ourselves from the inside.

After going over a few key definitions, we start to tackle the above questions, while exploring the range of recognized mental disorders and some of their treatments.

## Psychiatry, Psychology, Neurology

The ambiguity between the *medical* and *psychological* nature of mental disorders is also captured in the professions that typically treat these disorders.  A **psychiatrist** is a medical doctor (MD) who has special training in dealing with mental disorders, and is licensed to prescribe medications to treat disorders.  A **clinical psychologist** is an individual trained in various forms of therapy, typically with a Masters or PhD level degree, along with relevant state professional certification.  Recently, in some states, clinical psychologists with additional training can prescribe medications.  A **social worker** also has some clinical training and typically has a Masters-level graduate degree.  A **neurologist** is an MD who has more specialized training in direct brain-level interventions such as neurosurgery --- they are typically involved in diagnosing and treating more clearly biologically-based diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

Then you have people like me, who are non-clinical psychologists with PhD's who just try to figure out how the brain works, but aren't licensed or really able to help anyone with their particular disorders (despite the confusing fact that we are often addressed as "Dr.").  When I sit next to someone on the airplane, I always say I'm a "cognitive neuroscientist" because then they don't get uncomfortable and think I'm analyzing them, or ask me to diagnose them or something awkward like that.  Inevitably, they end up referring to me as a "neurologist" later, but whatever.

## The DSM-5 Disorders

The "bible" of mental disorders is known as the **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition** (**DSM-5**), published by the *American Psychiatric Association*, which represents the work of thousands of scientists in a highly contentious and controversial process to arrive a consensus all those thorny questions raised above.  How could it be otherwise?

Here is the very pragmatic answer that earlier versions of the DSM provide to one of the most important questions, **what counts as a disorder?**

> *a disorder must cause **distress** and / or **disability** (impairment in one or more important areas of functioning).*

The first criterion is fundamentally *subjective* (a report from the inside), which has many important implications, and is typically given a lot of weight in the diagnosing process.  Taken together, these two criteria help resolve many potentially problematic issues.  For example, if you're a "strange bird" that other people might tend to describe as "crazy", but you are personally not experiencing any distress, and you are able to manage the "important areas of functioning" (i.e., the tasks of daily life --- self-sufficiency for adults), then *you do not meet criterion for a disorder!"*

This definition also generally precludes the previously problematic situation, featured in a number of movies, where a ill-intentioned person could have someone locked up in a mental ward against their own wishes!  If there is sufficient cognitive functionality present to communicate and understand the situation, the subjective experience of the individual is essential.  This definition also helps deal with the *neurodiversity* question --- if you are a high-functioning autistic individual who is overall not experiencing undue distress, then you are not considered to have a disorder.

Interestingly, the DSM-5 revision introduced language that refers to biological causes and sounds more like the disease model, while retaining the key subjective distress criterion:

> *A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities.*

The introduction of the "usually" in there softens the distress a bit,and the dysfunction (disability) is seemingly more specific.  Another important criterion that has been consistently present sets some other important cultural and social boundaries:

> *An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.*

![**Figure 11.2:** Prevalence of mental disorders in the USA, for 2017.](figures/fig_mental_disorders_2017_usa.png){ width=70% }

With that general definition in hand, we will go through some of the major DSM disorders, in order of prevalence (Figure 11.2), and discuss general features of the disorder, including some of the major forms of treatment, which we will then cover in more detail below.

### Anxiety Disorders

These are the most prevalent, at nearly 7% of the US population, and include **generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)**, **panic disorder**, and specific **phobias** (e.g., fear of snakes, etc).  At some level, everyone has a pretty good subjective sense of anxiety and fear states, but to reach the status of a disorder, it must go beyond the "normal" level and cause significant distress and dysfunction.  Clearly, anxiety is distressing at pretty much any level, so this is again a subjective decision on the part of the individual to seek out treatment when the level of distress is excessive.  Also, given the level of severity associated with an official diagnosis, it is perhaps not surprising that anxiety disorders have a high level of comorbidity with depression (nearly 60%), consistent with the vicious cycle attractor model (Figure 11.1).

*Generalized anxiety disorder* is, as it sounds, a form of anxiety that applies across many situations, more-or-less continously every day, and it also must be long-lasting, typically over a period of 6 months or longer.  It seems likely that someone with this condition would experience distress and dsyfunction.

In contrast to the more sustained form of GAD anxiety, *panic disorder* is characterized by relatively brief but intense *panic attacks* that are temporarily disabling, and can lead to ongoing anxiety about when such attacks might recur.  **Agoraphobia**, technically the fear of open spaces, is strongly linked to panic disorder, and is associated with the fear of not having a place to hide should a panic attack occur.

The *specific phobias* are well known, involving things like spiders, snakes, heights, enclosed spaces, flying etc.  These are very common, and again the disorder criteria of distress and dysfunction apply.  For these cases, **exposure therapy** can be highly effective, typicall using **systematic desensitization**, which involves very gradually increasing exposing to feared item or situation, to build up associations with safety and extinguish the fearful one.  This is based direction on conditioning principles discussed in Chapter 5.  Interestingly, the exact opposite of systematic desensitization can also be effective, known as **flooding**, which gives maximal exposure to the feared item, in an otherwise safe environment, to the point where the fearful response is just exhausted out of the person.

Both GAD and panic disorder have significant genetic heritability, and are associated with changes in *amygala* and related brain areas.  Despite this potential biological basis, these and all other anxiety disorders are typically most effectively treated through *cognitive behavioral therapy* (CBT), as we discuss below.  There are also a variety of medications, particularly used for GAD, including SSRI's.  Overall, this is an area where therapy, particularly CBT, is a real success story from psychology, which is good considering how prevalent these disorders are.

I have personally suffered from periodic (roughly every decade), multi-week episodes of enhanced anxiety, and I was a very shy child and a *colicky* baby.  My "panic weeks" appear to have been triggered by events that led to an extreme contemplation of death, e.g., seeing the movie *Cooley High* in 1975 set off my first one (there is a scene where one kid just punches another kid to death), which also coincided with my sister going away to summer camp.  So some of this is likely dispositional, and some of it is situational, and some of it is because death is absolutely crazy and incomprehensible.

Interestingly, after my most recent episode, which could have been facilitated by recently turning 50, I have since noticed a strong relationship between indigestion symptoms and anxiety feelings, which may potentially connect to the colic.  And now science is finding quite a bit about this important connection, mediated by the *vagus nerve* [@BreitKupferbergRoglerEtAl18].  So that's my main experience with a potential mental disorder (otherwise I'm pretty boring), but it wasn't sufficiently long-lasting or intense as to cause significant dysfunction, even though it caused plenty of distress.  I did talk to my primary care doctor, who gave me some beta blockers, which kinda helped a bit.  I still felt a bit stigmatized by talking about it, but having taught this course really helped me understand how prevalent these things are.  And I definitely applied self-CBT and breathing exercises to good effect as well!

### Depressive Disorders

Depression is close to anxiety in prevalence, and is mainly accounted for by **major depressive disorder** (MDD), widely known as just "depression".  It is characterized by an extended period of depression lasting 2 weeks or longer, with symptoms of **depressed mood** (sadness) and **anhedonia** (inability to experience pleasure).  However, a more systematic analysis of the symptoms and their timecourse suggests that learned helplessness (lack of perceived self-control) and lack of self-efficacy are the most reliable, and that they both precede and outlast a depressive episode [@IacovielloAlloyAbramsonEtAl10].  In general there is a growing recognition that a previous focus on anhedonia and sadness [@WiseRompre89; @DisnerBeeversHaighEtAl11] (which is still the main focus of DSM-5) is less central than the effects on the motivational and self-efficacy aspects of the disorder [@TreadwayZald11; @SalamoneYohnLopez-CruzEtAl16].

The central role of motivational, self-efficacy effects in depression explains why so many other disorders have high comorbidity with depression -- it is a kind of "central node" among all disorders, consistent with the network model [@Borsboom17].  Specifically, the presence of any kind of distressing, dysfunctional disorder has the natural consequence of challenging an individual's sense of self-control and self-efficacy --- you no longer have the same sense of control over your mental world after the onset of such a disorder.  In the network model, you then transition to this new *node* in the network, which also brings with it pathways to other connected nodes.  For example, sleep impairments, which are common in depression, can result in compounding negative mood and less ability to exert self control over the primary disorder.  This then leads down the attractor surface into the vicious cycle of reinforcing negative symptoms that characterize depression, added on top of the primary disorder.

By understanding the emergent, dynamic nature of depression, and the critical role of sense of self-control and self-efficacy, it also makes it more clear why therapy that is focused on restoring self-efficacy has been demonstrated to be the most effective in treating most cases of depression [@DimidjianMartellHerman-DunnEtAl14].  This form of therapy is based on CBT, which is also effective for anxiety, but also includes *behavioral activation* components that work on restoring goal-engagement and a sense of competency in performing basic daily tasks.  Overall these effective forms of therapy are equally if not more effective than SSRI's or other medications for all but the most severe forms of depression [@GartlehnerWagnerMatyasEtAl17].

Interestingly, despite its somewhat "barbaric" reputation from various movies, electroconvulsive shock therapy is still widely used and is highly effective for more severe forms of depression.  Scientists are also experimenting extensively with milder forms of electrical and magnetic brains stimulation, with some positive results.  These therapies may work by literally strengthening synapses and neural activity in the frontal cortex, which then provides greater control and motivation activity overall.  Thus, it may work in a similar fashion to behavioral activation --- it is all about *activation* --- connecting back to the *BAS* framework and personality variables associated with this activation construct discussed in Chapter 9.

### Substance Use Disorders

The use of substances (drugs) is widespread, and is a case where the use of distress and dysfunction in the definition of a disorder is critical: only when the substance use reaches those criteria does it qualify as a disorder.  In addition to the basic criteria, 11 other criteria are listed, 2 of which must also be present to qualify as a disorder.  These include things like inability to reduce intake despite desire to do so, intense cravings, **tolerance** (needing increasing amounts to obtain desired effects), and **withdrawal symptoms** which are physiological effects that occur when reducing or eliminating intake.  Instead of the popular term **addiction**, clinicians prefer the term **dependence** which has less "baggage", and refers more specifically to the tolerance and withdrawal symptoms.

With the opiod crisis affecting the United States, there is an increasing awareness of the severe problems causes by substance use disorders.  Over 100,000 people died from all such disorders in 2017, including alcohol but excluding tobacco (which accounts for 480,000 annual deaths), taking a truly tragic toll.  Unfortunately, the rates of relapse when the dependence reaches the level of a disorder are around 40-60%, which indicates the insidious nature of these disorders.

A considerable amount of research has uncovered widespread brain changes associated with drugs of abuse, from cocaine to opioids.  They directly hijack the brain's endogenous reward pathways, which as we saw in Chapter 5 are normally under tight regulation to increase expectations and prevent runaway positive feedback loops.  However, drugs interfere with these regulatory mechanisms, despite the presence of tolerance which reflects these effects.  These lasting changes to the brain circuits makes people more vulnerable to relapse, explaining the high rates of recidivism.  There is nevertheless considerable hope that by learning more about how these circuits adapt to drugs, we can find suitable interventions that can restore their original, natural function.  When that happens, it will be as a result of years of investment in basic neuroscience research, which will pay for itself handsomely.

### Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating periods of depression and elevated mood, which in its extreme form is called **mania**, and this disorder used to be called **manic depression** for that reason.  If the elevated mood is less severe, it is known as **hypomania**, which according to some with the disorder, can be a particularly productive period of creativity.  Compared to the other disorders discussed so far, it has a higher level of heritability, although there are many different genes that have been associated with it, and no clearly identified biological cause outside of the same set of *usual suspects* discussed above (prefrontal cortex / basal ganglia etc).  Bipolar disorder is associated with a significantly higher level of *suicide* than other disorders, with nearly 50% of people attempting it at least once, and around a 20% lifetime mortality rate.  The most effective treatment is **lithium**, an element (in salt form) --- the precise mechanism by which it acts is unknown, but it does affect a number of pathways of relevance including **serotonin**.

A number of famous people have reported having bipolar disorder, including Kanye West, Carrie Fisher, Mel Gibson, Demi Lovato, Kurt Cobain, Frank Sinatra, Vivien Leigh, and Winston Churchill.  The memoirs from these and other people suggest that their struggles with this disorder shaped their lives in powerful ways, and led in some ways to their notable creativity.  The stereotype of the emotionally volatile "creative type" is consistent with this idea.  Also, like all disorders, bipolar has varying severity across individuals, and those who are able to make major accomplishments such as the famous people listed above may have relatively less severe cases.

### Eating Disorders

The two primary eating disorders, **anorexia nervosa** and **bulimia nervosa**, are widely known and unfortunately common, especially afflicting adolescent women.  Both are characterized with a struggle for self-control over eating and body image, with the pervasive and unrealistic images of women's bodies in popular media blamed for fueling these conditions.  Anorexia can be characterized as an extreme form of *conscientiousness* and in the domain of self-control over eating, exercise, and other means to reduce body weight.  This is consistent with generally increased frontal and reward pathway activation in these individuals [@Frank15], and with the high levels of comorbidity with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

While people with anorexia can demonstrate extreme levels of self-control (metaphorically, they don't even eat the one marshmallow in the Mischel task), bulimia is characterized by an oscillation between loss of control over eating (*binging*), followed by various forms of *purging* behavior to eliminate the excess intake.  Whereas people with anorexia have significantly reduced body weight, those with bulimia typically have normal weight.  In general, the brain responses of people with bulimia is more similar to people with obesity [@Frank15], which can also be characterized by reduced levels of control over eating behavior.

As with most other disorders, therapy is the most effective treatment, typically of a form that is more specifically adapted to these disorders, and often involving the family for adolescents.  

### Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is perhaps the one disorder that most directly captures the notion of a mental disorder in popular culture, involving **hallucinations** (more typically hearing voices than visual), **delusions**, and **disorganized thinking**.  These are known as the **positive symptoms** of schizophrenia, not because they have a positive valence or effect, but rather because they are novel, distinctive symptoms not present in neurotypical people.  The term *schizophrenia* literally means "split mind", and unlike *split personalities*, the split here captures the *dissociation* from reality, and also the pervasive sense that some other agent(s) or forces are controlling one's thoughts (but these are perceived as being external).  In contrast to the positive symptoms, there are **negative symptoms** (reduced aspects of normal functioning) that significantly overlap with those of depression, including reduced motivation, reduced sense of self-efficacy and control [@KrynickiUpthegroveDeakinEtAl18], and others that are more distinctive for schizophrenia (e.g., social withdrawal and impaired cognitive functions).

According to the *attractor* model, some of the negative symptoms could be a (perfectly reasonable) consequence of the experience of a loss of control over mental function represented by the positive symptoms, and thus would represent a comorbid depression disorder similar to what happens in many other disorders.  This account is consistent with a detailed analysis of differences between negative symptoms in schizophrenia and primary depression [@KrynickiUpthegroveDeakinEtAl18].  While both disorders overlap on the motivational and self-efficacy factors, depression uniquely involves pessimism, sadness, and suicidal thoughts, while negative symptoms uniquely involve factors such as poor attention and concentration, blunted affect, and social withdrawal.  These latter factors are consistent with impaired cognitive functions supported by the frontal cortex and associated brain areas.

Schizophrenia is typically treated using **antipsychotic** medications, all of which have some effect on *dopamine*, but also other neuromodulators, and help to control the positive symptoms.  In general the negative symptoms are not well treated by current treatments.  The essential role of dopamine in schizophrenia has been believed for a long time [@MeltzerStahl76], but more recent data is suggesting that it may play a somewhat different role than previously thought [@McCutcheonAbi-DarghamHowes19], involving the basal ganglia.

A notable and scientifically important aspect of schizophrenia is its developmental nature: There are a number of indications that schizophrenia is often caused by events that take place early in development, but do not manifest until early adulthood.  Overall, it is significantly heritable, but genetic analyses have found no strong associations with specific genes, consistent with many other phenotypes such as intelligence, as discussed in Chapter 10.  In general, it is thought to require the interaction of biological predispositions with significant environmental events, which is true of most disorders, as we discuss below.

One particularly well-studied etiology of schizophrenia is **maternal immune activation** (MIA), which has been studied in rodent and monkey models, caused by activation of the mother's immune response during specific periods in gestation [@Meyer14; @EstesMcAllister16; @Meyer19]. Animals with this MIA exposure go on to develop a number of biological and behavioral characteristics of schizophrenia (and autism as well).  In humans, there are a number of cases where pandemic outbreaks have been associated with significant increases in children who went on to develop mental disorders including schizophrenia and autism.  For example, the 1964 Rubella virus pandemic resulted in a 20% incidence of schizophrenia for children of affected mothers (compared to less than 1% otherwise).

The details of how exactly the immune activation translates into brain-level changes that then cascade over development into the onset of schizophrenia roughly 20-30 years later are still under intensive investigation [@EstesMcAllister16].  There are indications that the dopamine system is affected, while one recent result shows a signal associated with immune activation in the brains of people with schizophrenia, specifically in the prefrontal cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex [@LeshMaddockHowellEtAl19].  Thus, the initial seed of the deficit could be due to relatively subtle changes in neural function in these critical control and motivational areas of the brain, which cascade and accumulate through development to produce impaired internal control mechanisms, resulting in the disorganized thinking and specific negative symptoms.  

Some insight into the nature of this cascade is provided by a network analysis of the order in which the different symptoms of schizophrenia tend to unfold over time.  Interestingly, [@VanKampen14] found using two different techniques that socially-related symptoms tended to develop first (social anxiety, social withdrawal), and that these then led to a corresponding cluster of symptoms reflecting the attempt to create a more independent identity, and rejection of society (egocentrism, fantasy world, alienation, suspicion, hostility).  Only after this initial trajectory do the more extreme "signature" aspects of the disorder present, in the form of delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thought.

In short, according to this analysis, the *schism* at the heart of schizophrenia is actually between the individual and society, which is consistent with a wide range of other data on social isolation and social cognition in schizophrenia [@GreenHoranLee15; @GreenHoranLeeEtAl18], including an animal model based on social isolation during the critical adolescent period, which produces schizophrenia-like symptoms [@SunMinZhouEtAl17].  This social isolation framework also helps to explain why schizophrenia manifests when it does: late adolescence and early adulthood are exactly when the *coming of age* story described in Chapter 9 is supposed to resolve into a newfound sense of one's place in society.

As for how delusions and hallucinations may arise, the *self-model* from Chapter 9 would likely be challenged by a breakdown in cognitive control --- if the conscious *self* is not seeming to be in control, perhaps there are other active agents influencing the flow of thoughts, which could be experienced as voices and other mechanisms of external thought insertion.  Thus, these delusions and hallucinations could just be an attempt to make sense of the new subjective experience that doesn't fit with everything following from a single coherent conscious self --- it must be that the CIA is doing something to control my thoughts!
