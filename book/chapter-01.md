# Chapter 1: Science and Subjectivity -- The Fundamental Challenge of Psychology

Psychology is the science that attempts to understand the human mind.  The human mind is the most fascinating and amazing "thing" in the known universe, and the idea that you can actually attempt to study it using the basic reductionistic approach of science may seem a bit of a stretch.  And indeed it has been -- but at this point in the development of the field, most practicing scientists are likely to feel rather confident that significant progress has been made, without fundamental obvious limitations to how far we can go.

In this chapter, we throw a major wrench into that optimism, and wrestle with the fundamental challenge that has shaped the field from its inception: The inescapable problem of *subjectivity*.  Subjectivity here is not just the fact that different people have different opinions or perspectives on things, though that is a big part of it.  Stepping back a bit to the *really big picture*, we need to start with the fundamental problem of subjectivity as expressed by Rene Descartes (way back in 1637), in his famous statement: *Cogito Ergo Sum* -- *I think therefore I am.*

There are two essential implications of this statement -- we'll explore the first one in depth before turning to the second.  The first implication is that *subjective experience is primary*.  If you put yourself into the mindset of a very skeptical, doubting philosopher, you might just about be able to get yourself to question everything, *except* this one, primary fact: you are sitting there (wherever you are), *thinking*.  If you really push it, you might appreciate that you can't really be sure that the world itself exists outside of your mind!  This very challenging train of thought is well-captured in several modern movies, perhaps most notably in the *Matrix* series, where, in fact (in the movie at least), there turns out to be every reason to have such doubts.  In philosophical circles, this line of thinking is known as *solipsism*.

This is the kind of all-encompassing subjectivity that we want to more fully understand and appreciate.  What does this line of thinking mean for the study of Psychology, or Science more generally?  

This is where we can usefully bring in Descartes' second major implication from *Cogito Ergo Sum*: *dualism*.  Dualism is the idea that there are two fundamentally different "substances" in the universe: the regular physical stuff of the everyday world, and this entirely separate, magical transcendent thing called *mind*, which lives apart from that other, regular stuff.  The opposing view is called *materialism*, where the mind is seen as just a product of the material world like everything else, and in particular a product of the physical processes taking place within the *brain*, as widely embraced in modern Neuroscientific approaches to Psychology.

You might be somewhat surprised to hear that many modern-day philosophers still embrace this dualism, and one of the most outspoken advocates is David Chalmers, who argues that subjective experience, or *qualia*, is the *hard problem* of consciousness and simply cannot be explained in objective, materialistic, scientific terms.

You might be even more surprised to hear that I actually agree (in spirit at least, so to speak) with Chalmers, and Descartes!  I think that there are two fundamentally different "substances" in the universe, but, unlike Descartes and Chalmers, I don't think the dividing line is between *mind* and *matter*, but rather, between *subjective* and *objective*.  Again, following Descartes, we can take subjective experience as primary -- it is the only thing I am fully certain of.  But it is also primary in another, essential way: it is uniquely, completely, definitionaly, *mine*.  It is literally impossible for *you* to experience *my* subjective experience, because, by definition, *my* subjective experience is exactly the sum-total of what it "feels like" to be me.  If we somehow were to add *you* into my brain, my subjective experience would be irreparably altered.  If you are somehow sharing in my subjective experience as it is happening, you would have to have direct access to every level of my brain, and not just "objective" access as you might get from a super-hi-tech future brain scanner, but *direct*, *internal*, *subjective* access, "from the inside out".

In other words, you would have literally be inside my brain.  And you can't be inside my brain because I'm already here.  From the materialist perspective, we can identify my subjective experience as emerging from my brain -- it is what it feels like to be my brain.  If you truly appreciate this equivalence, then it should be readily apparent than there can be only one "mind" for every brain.

Another way of thinking about this is in terms of identical twins.  Let's imagine we have the most identical of identical twins ever to exist.  Their brains are *completely identical* in every way possible.  Would those twins have the same subjective experience? No.  They might have a great deal in common, but, fundamentally, they would not, and could not, directly experience exactly what the other is experiencing.  Why not?

It all boils down to *perspective*.  Each physical thing in the universe has its own unique perspective, if we take this term to mean a particular spatial location, and a particular trajectory through space and time in the past (and going onward into the future), that is fundamentally *unique* to that thing.  This is why the twins cannot share their subjective experiences: they are two separate, distinct things, and, inevitably, they "see the world" from two different vantage points.  The only way they could share experiences is if they could somehow superimpose themselves into exactly the same point in space, and do so over a sufficiently long time period to synchronize their history of experience (which plays such a critical role in our subjective life, in addition to the immediate sensations coming in from the outside world).

Anyway, the key point of all this, whether I've managed to convey it sufficiently clearly and compellingly or not, is that *IF* you allow that subjective experience can never be shared among different brains, *THEN* it follows that there is a fundamental divide between this inner subjective world, and the "regular" outside *objective* world.  I believe this divide captures the essence of what Chalmers is talking about in terms of the irreducible nature of the qualia of consciousness -- the impossibility of trying to explain in objective terms "what it feels like" to experience things in our subjective, inner world.  Furthermore, it does so without introducing anything particularly magical or fundamentally at odds with materialism: subjective experience is not separate from the physical world in terms of some kind of magical "substance" that it is constituted from -- it is just separate in terms of this notion of *perspective* -- the unique point of view (literally, where they are standing / sitting / looking) that each subjective being has all to themselves.

## Subjectivity in Psychology: A Brief History

Stepping back from this big philosophical abyss, what does this all mean for the attempt to study Psychology as a Science?  The primary, obvious problem is that Psychology is the study of *what it is like to be a human being*, and if this is fundamentally a subjective thing that can never be directly shared with any other human being, how can we possibly hope to arrive at some kind of objective, scientific understanding?  Well, the first step is to follow Chalmers and attempt to *partition the problems* -- we can carefully attempt to set aside the *hard problems* associated with the nature of subjective experience, and focus instead on the so-called *easy problems* that are left over.  *If* there is enough interesting stuff left over in this space of easy problems, then it probably makes pragmatic sense to just see how far we can get in trying to understand that stuff, and then, once we seem to have exhausted that space, perhaps we could circle back and start reconsidering some of those hard problems.

This overall approach provides a reasonable narrative for the history of Psychology as a scientific discipline.  The person most widely credited with founding the Science of Psychology, Willhelm Wundt, had the innovative idea in the late 1800's that, after millenia of armchair speculation, you could actually apply the techniques of empirical science to understanding the human mind / brain.  Wundt made many groundbreaking contributions, but his legacy, at least at the level of introductory Psychology texts, is as a founder of the *introspectionist* school of Psychology.  When the next major paradigm shift took place in the early 1900's, it emerged as as strong reaction and rejection of this introspectionist approach, which was characterized as being overly concerned with all those hard problems of subjective experience.  Introspectionists would try to systematize and characterize the contents of subjective experience, and the hard-nosed *behaviorists* who came next regarded these investigations as insufficiently objective, rigorous, and replicable.  Instead, they emphasized purely objective, externally-observable *behavior* as the only valid data in Psychology (hence the term behaviorism), and the main figures in this era (e.g., John B. Watson, B. F. Skinner, and Ivan Pavlov) focused on how external, objetive factors such as reward and punishment affected subsequent behavior through *conditioning*.

Thus, these first two epochs of scientific Psychology embody exactly this tension between the subjective and objective worlds.  The next paradigm shift took place in the 1950's and 60's with the *Cognitive Revolution*, riding the wave of digital computers, which made it fashionable to start talking about internal mental operations in terms of the *information processing model* of the mind -- i.e., the mind as a computational device.  Scientists leading this new field, such as Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, started thinking about how the mind could perform complex mental operations such as scientific proofs, chess, and other challenging tasks.  People started creating running computer models of how these internal thought processes might work, which provided a compelling way to render that formerly "loosey-goosey" internal world in a much more rigorous, objectively-characterizable way.

However, as parallel work in the field of Neuroscience continued to advance, it gradually became clear that the brain really doesn't work anything like a standard digital computer.  Instead, it is really a huge *parallel* computer with billions of computing elements (neurons) that combine the functions of computation and memory, which are otherwise separated in a standard digital computer.  Psychologists David Rumelhart and James McClelland published a ground-breaking pair of books in the mid 1980's that popularized this new understanding of how information processing might work in the brain, and subsequent advances in the ability to take high-resolution pictures of the activity inside the human brain (*neuroimaging*) have led to the currently-dominant paradigm that integrates Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology (i.e., Cognitive Neuroscience) to come up with coherent understanding of how exactly the brain gives rise to the phenomena of the mind.

## Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience

This book is grounded squarely in this new paradigm of cognitive neuroscience, and attempts to provide a coherent set of core principles that connect directly from the basic processing carried out by individual neurons, all the way up to the highest levels of mental life.  We are still largely avoiding significant consideration of the vast inner world of subjective life, but there is a robust field studying the *neural correlates of consciousness* (NCC) that we will discuss in depth in Chapter X.  Slowly, we are building bridges between the objectively-identifiable properties of the human brain, and the subjective experiences that tend to co-occur with particular such brain states.  Thus, we are developing a richer objective understanding about the kinds of neural mechanisms that give rise to our subjective mental life.  But even with all of these advances, I don't think we could ever explain to a non-human-brain lifeform what it feels like subjectively to be a human brain.  Thus, the subjective world remains our own private dominion, and probably literature, art, and movies provide the richest vehicles for sharing those experiences across the inevitable subjective gap between us all.
