# Introduction

Introductory Psychology textbooks typically provide a rather fragmented, fact-laden view of the field, relying on colorful graphics and exciting news stories and personal anecdotes to generate interest in the material.  This book represents a radical departure from that approach.  Here, we will attempt to provide a simple, principled account of the human mental world and how it emerges from our brains, that is coherent across the entire scope of phenomena covered in typical Intro Psych texts.

The overall portrait we paint of you looks something like this (caution: it is not overly flattering): You are obsessed with controlling your environment to satisfy a range of core desires and mitigate strong fears, and are unlikely to be swayed by other people's advice, but have no problem dishing it out.  A challenge to your social standing or any other form of disrespect (the _diss_) is one of the worst offenses, and you are willing to spin all manner of stories to maintain your sense of order in the world, _especially_ when that sense is strongly challenged.  You crave simple ways of understanding the world that massively oversimplify the true complexities and ambiguities, preferring to think in terms of simple, concrete anecdotes instead of broad abstractions, logical arguments, or statistics.  You think you know how most stuff you use everyday works (bikes, cars, toilets..), but studies show that you are actually remarkably clueless.  You only care about things that are new and unexpected, and are constantly comparing and evaluating yourself and others with a keen eye for who is doing better or worse along any number of important dimensions (wealth, beauty, smarts, athletic ability, popularity -- you name it!).  You are hypersensitive to who might be cheating or gaming the system, but are perhaps not so aware of unfair advantages you might have.  More generally, you tend to think of yourself as being "your own person" and strongly underestimate how strong of an influence other people actually have over you.  If you're honest with yourself, you'll admit that you spend way too much time thinking about what what other people think of you -- without recognizing that everyone else is doing the same thing, so that in fact the answer is a somewhat disappointing: "not much" (unless of course you do something embarrassing or strange or stupid, but even then, your memory of those events will typically far outlast those of others).

In other words, you are a survivor.  You are a tough cookie.  Your ancestors survived unbelievable hardships to get you here, to your relatively plush college-educated world.  You are amazingly efficient.  All those crazy details you don't know about the world are largely irrelevant anyway.  Seriously, does it really matter that you don't know how the engine or transmission in your car works?  You can drive, and get to where you need to go -- and that is what really matters.  Your brain is exquisitely tuned into what really matters, and despite over 60 years of attempts to recreate the magic of your brain in a computer, nothing has come even close (despite all the recent media hype to the contrary).

And yet, despite all your toughness and amazing abilities, almost everyone of you has some level of significant mental dysfunction.  Many of you suffer from depression, or anxiety disorders, and often both of those together.  Unfortunately, the promise of a magic pill to cure these afflictions has turned out to be yet another disappointment.  

Surprisingly, we can make sense of all these different things using only 3 core principles...
